 Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I ...
                                               Me?

                     This isn't going well at all.
       No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.
 Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost s...

                Come on, you're holding out on me.
                              Think nothing of it.
                      Hey, what's the matter, son?

        I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
    Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.
                       Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah.
                                    How do I look?
                   Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
             What are all our friends names again?
                           Why not? I paid for it.

              Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?
                       It was me! You fell for it!
 You should see the look on your face. It's pri...

                    That thing you know how to do.
                                        Go to bed.

        Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
                               Why? What'd you do?
                                            Marge!
                         Where-where are we going?
                                  The way I acted?
 So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes...
                                   I put it there.
            I slipped it into your glass as a gag.

                        Whoa, better get some gas.
 Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
                                     Catfish Lake.
 Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's Ge...

                                               Oh.
     I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
           Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
 Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her ...
                                    She's perfect.
             Well, sometimes that can be annoying.
                                         I'm done.
                         It's true. It's all true.
                                            Sorry.
                I only did that a couple of times.

 You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I ...
                                               No.

                Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!
 Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength...
                                    Good! Give up!
                                              Huh?
 Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm ...

 I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me...
 I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does ever...

 Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up an...
                   Bart, have you seen the letter?
 All right, think very carefully. Where did you...

                              Why did you do that?
                 I'll show you mad in the morning.

                                     I don't know.
                                 Great plan, Bart.
 Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's...

                      Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?

                                      Who are you?
             I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons.
 Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd ...
                              Doesn't ring a bell.
                           What was that last one?
                                             Nope.
     Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
                    No, that thing with your feet.
                      Because I wore a pink shirt.
                                  What'd you wear?

                Pancakes... football... Boobies...
                              Was the door locked?

                 But the note was asking you to --

                                               Oh.
                            Oh, it's all my fault.
                                        Yes it is.
                                No, I was a swine.
   Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?
           Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!

               ... Bart! Have you started smoking?
                              Don't lie to me boy.

                      Sheesh. What a slave driver.
                                  No. Bart bit me.
           I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
 I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just ...

 Hmm. "Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxopho...
            Please, you've got to open that store.
 Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of...
              I'll have you know, I wrote it down.
             Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
            Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!
                                          I dunno.
                                               No.
                                               No.
 No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one a...
           Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father.
                                            Uh-oh.
                             Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!
      I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
                   That cost eighty-eight dollars!
 Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know t...
                             You didn't mean that!
 No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed t...

 See, even when you yell at me, I can see love ...
                               Ha ha, you love me.
                                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
                                               Mm.
                                              Buh.
                                             Sneh.
                    Excuse me, do you sell ponies?
       "Scot-tish deer-hound." Hey, this is a dog!
 Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little g...
                          Half a million dollars?!
                                              Wow!
                                     I'll take it!
             Uh, sure... let me write you a check.
                     Is there a problem with that?
 Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up...
       I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
                Mr. Burns, you do this personally?
                                          U-su-ry?
                             I want to buy a pony.
 No. I need to get it for my little girl becaus...
                                            Sorry.
                                        Of course.
                    Simpson, you've done it again.
 Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of he...
                    Because she stopped loving me.
 I know you love me. So you don't get squat. He...
 I've got it all figured out. By day it will ro...
 That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she lo...
                    Stable? That sounds expensive.
                  This is what love costs a month?
                                          Oh nuts.
                       I was hoping it'd be money.
 Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vacc...
               Nah, we're not gonna be doing that.
 First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now,...
             Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays.
 Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out ther...
   Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
                           Need money. Need money.
                     One Scratch-for-Cash, please.
 Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, ...
                                        Thank you.
                                      There it is.
                                               No.
                                           No! No!
                     No! You can't see... come on!
                                               No!
                        Let go. You're ripping it.
                              Ohh... I need money.
                          You're looking for help?
                                     I'm your man!
                                          Woo-hoo!
                                ...Badge of honor.
                                  But I eat... Oh.
                       Heh heh, the perfect crime.
 Marge, could we go in the other room? I did so...
 I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, s...

                                          Yes sir.
            I don't know. How long do horses live?
                 Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
                                           Y'ello.
         Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?
                     Going for... eight hour walk.
                                  Homer sleep now.
                             Coming right up, sir.
                                         Yes, sir.
 Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing ...
                                          You did?
                Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!
                                             Awww.
       Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!
                      That baby changed our lives.
               Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
                                    In the garage.
                    Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.
      If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
                            Okay, okay, calm down.
                             Okay, I will. I will.

                   I don't know. Some guy I guess.
                                         How much?
 What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to ...
                      Anything for my little girl.
 Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame....
                                  Ooooooh, McBain.
                    Why? I just saw the best part.
  Just grab something. All these movies are great.
          Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman.
                                         Oh Marge.
 Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's...
                                       Okay. Hank.

     Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.
                           Then he has no hobbies.
                                  Bart!... BART!!!

 Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are...

                               Oh, how I envy you!
     I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
                                         What boy?
       Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.
     Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
                        Okay. No, I'm gonna do it.
 But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot...

 Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry ...
      Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!
                                               No!

                                            Sorry.
                       No. Can't think of a thing.

                                  He's not so fat.
                       Bart, why are you still up?
 Boy, they've got better things to talk about t...
                                  What is it, boy?
 Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, yo...

                        That's it. I'm outta here.
                           What's the matter, Moe?
                  Yeah, things are tough all over.
                               Could I get a beer?
 Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot...
 One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing...
 As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick,...
   Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?
 I decided to mix the little bits that were lef...
 In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids...
      It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
 I don't know the scientific explanation, but f...
                                A "Flaming Homer".
                 Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?
                          Try lighting it on fire.
                   Well, it's called a "Flaming...
 Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded sin...
                                      Why yes I --
 I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is...
                        Take that off this second!
                            I need to talk to Moe.
                   I didn't even tell you my name.
                                    Homer Simpson.
                                             But--
                                           Barney?
                          You're my kid's teacher!
                                               No!
                                 Get away from me.
                                         Hey, Moe?
                I'd rather have a "Flaming Homer".
 How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was...
 If there was any justice, my face would be on ...
 Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. ...
        I said, you just lost yourself a customer!
                You just lost yourself a customer.
           You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!
                You just lost yourself a customer.
                You just lost yourself a customer.
                         Ah, my new watering hole.
                                           A beer?
                         Can I have a clean glass?
 Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing...
 Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm...
            Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.
                              Moe... Moe... Moe...
                                Moe... Moe... Moe.
              Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe...
 Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures...
 Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over...
          Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?
 Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of...
                                       I guess so.
 Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a...
   Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?
                            Oh, what do they want!
                                    It's not fair!
                                           Uh-huh.
                       Ooh, that's a lot of money.

                                      I own stock?
                     So uh, how much did it go up?
                                           Yeah...
                                           Sure...
                                   Not any more...
                                  That'd be great.
                              Well... how are you?
                 Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?
                                 What should I do?
   Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
           Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer...
 No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Priva...

   Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?
 Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it f...
                                       Hey... hey!
                                        You heard?
     Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too.
                               I spent it on beer.
 Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talkin...
        What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
                                               Ow!
       Did you buy this car with your stock money?
                       We could all lose our jobs.
                         Well, they can't fire me.
                                       Cuz... I...

 Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know...
                         Good, good, I'm learning.
                       Because we send them money?
                                    Oh, woa is me.
         Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it.

 Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so ...

 Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say...
                                 No problems here.
       I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!
 That's right. I lost my job so that you could ...
 Let me ask you something. Does your money chee...
 Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, doe...
               And does it ever say, "I love you?"
 Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old...
                               Nobody loves you...
                       Na na na na / Na na na na /
                       Woo-hoo! I got my job back!
 But Marge, this one came with a free corncob p...
           Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?

 Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games...
                Yeah, but I have to hear about it.
 Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your moth...
 Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of...
 For several years I'd been dating your mother ...
                                         Yes, sir.

                                       Phew, good.
          Really? It must be the Champale talking.
          Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
                            Pass the cookie dough.
                         Y'ello... Oh, hi Marge...
                                Why? What's wrong?
                                               Oh.
                                           ... ...
           Because it's the honorable thing to do?
 Marge, there's something I want to ask you. Bu...
           Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?
 Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a car...
                                    What's it say?
                    That's the card. Give it here.
                          So... will you marry me?
 Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. ...
 You know, I had this very same discussion with...
 Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call ...
                    They'll call him Screwy Louie.
                                             Slob.
                                             Puke.
                                           Mucous.
 Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, ...
                                     I don't know.
 Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much...
         Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.
 Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a bett...
                                             I am?

                                             I do.
         Our first night together as man and wife.

               Holy cow, you're as big as a house.
 No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I...
                                   Marge, for you.
                                         Oh, sure.
                         Because I knocked you up?

                           Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!
    Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver.
                        Twenty big ones on Denver.
               All right, Denver. Justify my love.
                             Lousy, stupid Denver.

               What? Didn't you hear what he said?
             You think we should bet against them?
                                       You got it.
            Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York.
 Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon...
                          My daughter, that's who!
 Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You...
        Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.
                 Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.
        The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills.
 I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. ...
             Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.
          Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer.
                                   Oh, violin guy!
                  What's your favorite song, Lisa?
                                          Play on.
 Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy ...

 Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait!...
                                Uh...the last one.
 That was his dish, and that was his leash, and...
                Oh, Marge! There is no such place!

                         Oooh, there's a good one.
          Marge, that's just a suggested car size.
       Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?
 Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, ...

                               Ooh, a redneck bar.
                                      Duff please.
                                    Okay, Fudd me.
                  Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
                                           Yeah...
                                  ... that's true.
                                           Uh-huh.
       That's right, except for the pick-up truck.

                                 Homer J. Simpson.
                             That's a pretty name.
                 Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
                                      Bye Lurleen.
                                           Y'ello.

            Do you think I could get a copy of it?
 Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and ...

                                       I guess so.

                                Marge, look at me.
         Uh, then maybe you better not look at me.
                        A friend bought it for me.
                       No... I think it was Lenny.
                                               No!
                                               No!
                                   A coupla times.
                         I can't. I'm her manager.

                    I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
 Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. ...
 Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one...
 I don't have time to answer all these question...
                                          Stop it.
                               You, off the bench.
       Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV.
 Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now o...

                                       Never mind.
 I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things...
 I gave Herb all the money I had in the world.....

 Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?
                 I don't see your name on it, boy.
                                          Oh yeah?
                                    Check... mate.

                                 Oh no you're not.
                                         He-he-he.
   Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds!
                               And look. New hair!
             I'm this close to having a comb-over!

                               Sounds interesting.
                               A beaut from Butte.
                           Nothin' could be finah.
                          She, uh... Good for her.
                      Marge keep it down in there.
                          Maggie! Cut that racket!
                  And where exactly are you going?
      Well, this is the first I've heard about it.
 Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me ...
                                 Kids, back me up.
                               Match point, Homer.
            That's okay. We're none of us perfect.
 Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any...
                                  Make Bart do it.

          Wha th... Why are you talking like that?
                     I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock.
                    But Marge, what about dessert?
                                     Fine. I will!
 Oh no! My pudding is trapped forever. So I can...

 I wasn't bored. I was sad. It really got to me...

                            I... found... a penny!
            Could this be the best day of my life?
                Looks like we have a new champion.

                               Where are we going?
 Kids, let me tell you about another so-called ...
 There you go again. Always taking someone else...
                                        Very sure.
 Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait,...
         Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?
                                            Sorry.
                  Apu, I see you're not in church.
                       Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?
 No offense Apu, but when they were handing out...
                Boy, everyone is stupid except me.

 Fire! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, the song...
                      Flanders, you saved me. Why?

 You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here.

                                     I don't know.
             I thought there was chocolate inside.
                 Well, why was it wrapped in foil?

                                About three weeks.
     Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk.
                                       What? What?
                   All right, you win round seven.
                                   Your what-what?
 Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know!...
 Wait a minute. That was a "Lucy" show... Okay,...
         Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in...
 Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me...
                                     Hi, Flanders.
                            I could use a TV tray.
                                            Whaat?

            Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius.
 I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed...

     Where's the beef? No wonder he won Minnesota.
                                I like those odds.
         Please, please, please, please, please...
                              Can you say "Daddy"?
                        U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!...
                 Here, Bart, you can hold my beer.
                                             What?
                                 Goodnight, honey.
 Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah.
                             No, sweetie. "Daddy."
 Y'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the soon...
                      I hope you never say a word.
 I can't wait till they throw his hatless butt ...
                          My heart is just fine...
   Just workin' the turkey through. There it goes!
 You know that feeling you get when a thousand ...

                                 Come on, come on!
 I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumpin...
        Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission.
                                              Huh?
                                             More.
                                        Thank you.
      Marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes.

                       Does whiskey count as beer?
         Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor.
                          It's my life-long dream.
                                         Oh, yeah.
         Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true.
                                That's right, boy.

                            Are we gonna die, son?

 Bart, warm up the car. We're going to Duff Gar...
 Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket ...
              And I'm a college student! Heh, heh.
        But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now!
 I'm not pouting. I'm... mourning. Stupid dead ...
                     Ding-dong, the witch is dead.
                          Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.
              Hey you don't hear Lisa complaining.
   Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's good.
                                             What?
                      All right, I'm almost there.
                                           Please.
 Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie po...
                       It's just not fair, dammit!
                All in favor of skipping the poem?
                                        Thank you.
                                           Uh, oh.
                 Sure... unless another aunt dies.
 Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty despera...
                                      I knew that.
                                   Sand... wich...
                         I'll give it a good home.
     Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge.
                                 Suggestion noted.
 Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich ...
                                              Yes.
          I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens.
                                       S-s-o cold.
                    No! Duff... Gardens... hurrah!
                                But I love solids.
 This is all your fault! Oh, how can I stay mad...

 You take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around...
                                    I'm on my way!
                             What'd ya say, Marge?
    Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something.
                I can't think with all this noise!
                         What am I supposed to do?
                Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?

                                           Hit me.
                                           Hit me.
                        Hey, boy! Where you going?
                  Have a good time! Wait a minute.
                                     So that's it!
                  Hello, son. Where have you been?

 Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-e...
                   Ehhh, maybe this was a mistake.

                                             Pepi.
                                I gave it to Pepi.
 He's my little brother. That's right -- you're...
 Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I...

          Oh... it's you. So, you're looking well.
             For your information, I'm his father!
               That's right. And who might you be?
          Look! There's another disadvantaged boy.
                                        Oh. Right.
          This is even more painful than it looks.
                                      Thanks, son.
                                             Yeah?
                                        Sure, boy.
 First, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep...
         And then when he's lying on the ground...
                           Kick him in the ribs...
              Step on his neck, and run like hell.
                         Happy... Valentine's Day!
                                          Woo hoo!

                Perhaps this might be appropriate.
                 Yes! You saved my life. How much?
     What? That's highway robbery! I won't pay it!
                                   Forget it, pal!
        All right. But I'll never shop here again.
                                             Sold!
                       I'd sell my first-born son.
                           You'll do as your told.

                        Thank you, that'd be nice.

                                            I see.
 All right. But if he starts to wig out, try to...
                         Will this be on the test?
                                         Nooooooo!
     This is not happening. This is not happening.

                         Hey kids. How was school?
                                    That's my boy.

                                            Uh-oh.

         Well, you haven't heard the last of them.

 Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war...
                Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head.

 It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for...
                                         Sure did.
                  Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.

                                      There we go.
       That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
                           Yep, it's finally gone.
 If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break ...

                                   What up, Marge?
                 Marge, can I go outside and play?
            And that sends me into a shame spiral.
      Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.
                And I feel that you hear my shame.
                         I feel validated by that.

                                      Who are you?
                                      Sir Isa-who?
          Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters?
 Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tun...
               Ooh, I would live in a big mansion?
                I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves?
                             Then we're all happy.
                                 Marge lives here?
 OH MINDY, YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKIN...

       Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.
                                               Oh!
 Oh. Something's missing. Ooh, one of the turke...

                                      It's a sign!
                                       Go to hell!
 Heh, you know, I was a little worried about co...
                                              Huh?
              Is there any way to get out of this?
                                          Oh yeah.
              Well I guess you'll want to come in.
                                             Okay.
                                       Yeah, yeah.
 Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have...
                 Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
                             But they're so sweet.
 Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about ...
                                         Oh, baby.
                                    Mmmm... Marge.
 OH, MARGIE, YOU CAME AND YOU FOUND ME A TURKEY...

 Strike three, Marge. I remember that meeting, ...

                                               No!
                         Marge, you waited for me.
                            Okay, Marge, let's go.
                        Marge, I'm taking the car.
          This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
                                          Marge...
 Wait. I see what's happening here. You're just...
 You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Coll...
 Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let...
 Marge, we need to talk. You're spending too mu...
                          Woo hoo! Problem solved!
                        Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What's up?
 Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all ...
 Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll ge...
 Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may...
 Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident inv...
                              Aw. Just like on TV.
 Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that...
 It's always something isn't it? First, I have ...
                                Ow...ow...ow...ow.
                               Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
                             Oh yeah, the costume.
                                  Hello, Floreeda.
 No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gamblin...
 Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn ...
                                   Can't talk now.
                You broke a promise to your child.
 You promised Lisa to help her with her costume...
 Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling...
 No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it ...
                      Can't talk. Robbed. Go hell.
 You know, Marge, for the first time in our mar...
 Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing...
 Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambl...
                Well, you have a gambling problem!
                                   Aw, what a gyp.
                            And remember when I...
                        Oh yeah. I forgot already.
                                          Woo hoo!
                           Eh, that's no big loss.
 Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of...
                                 Shhh, quiet Lisa.
                           Curse you, Magic Beans.
 Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I w...
                      Let me check my reason list.
                                Yep. It's on here.
 Alright, these are our new family security rul...
                        Marge, they're only human.
 Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got...
 Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-...
 Aw, honey. I didn't realize how much that horn...
           You know Lisa, music helps daddy think.
      I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?
                                 I'm someone else!
 We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someo...
                       Sorry, Dad. You're too old.
 Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, bu...
            Marge, we're responsible adults and...
 ... and if a group of responsible adults can't...
 Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake...
              No, we're forming a vigilante group.
               Put this in your pipe and smoke it.
                         Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
         Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs!
                                            Sorry.
       Okay, men, it's time to clean up this town.
 You know, push people around, make ourselves f...
            Bart, give me that megaphone of yours.
 Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me...
                                 Move along there.
    Return to your homes and places of businesses!
          Hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?
                                          Get him!
               No burning leaves without a permit!
                                         Too late.
 You better have a good reason for doing that, ...
                       You're in. Here's the sack.
 So I said to him, "Look buddy, your car was up...

                                       He'll show.
                                     It's his job.
                                   He's a burglar.

                   Oh, this doesn't work any more.
                                I didn't say stop.
                        Aw, Dad, I could kiss you.
             No wait! I know where the burglar is!
 So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been...
    Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa.
 I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat bur...
                                          Shut up.
                                       No kidding.
 Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and...

              Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!
  He's a box! My boy's a box! Damn you! A boooxxx!
  Marge, I have some horrible, bone chilling news.
                                      Oh, nothing.

   Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today.
                                     There, there.
 Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that...
               Come on, Lisa. Say something funny.
 Oh, something stupid like Bart would say. Buck...
 Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing...
          What the hell are you readin' books for?
             Don't forget to say "I didn't do it".
                            How do you figure boy?
 All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out ...
                       That dog can sell anything.
                 What kind of catchphrase is that?
                              Woo hoo! Cheap meat!
                            Oooh, this one's open!
 Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... No...
                       Your old meat made me sick!
     This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
                                          Woo hoo!
 Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is ...
                                          Bor-ing.

 You can't sell that. Karma can only be portion...
                            Is he still out there?
 What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa...
 Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chip...
 Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to...
                                       Outrageous.
              Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there.
                                 Pass the chutney.
 That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
 Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are ...
                           Ub. Apu friend me good.
                                      That's okay.

                              Are we in India yet?
                              Are we in India yet?
                              Are we in India yet?
                              Are we in India yet?
                       This isn't very convenient.
       Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
                                           Really?

                                           Boring.

 Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game...
                                       Well, yeah.
       Duck! I can't let the boys see me with you!
                                               Hi.
                                             Yeah.

                                      Heh heh. Ow.
            Well, I guess I should pay my share...
     Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned.
      NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN.

                So, here's to my best friend, Ned.
                                       Food fight!

                                         Too late.

                 Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?
                              Right, no reporters.
                                           O-okay.
 Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine do...
                               Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE!
                     Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.
 Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-as...

                               Get lost, Flanders.
 See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about...

 Son, when you participate in sporting events, ...
                               Push her down, son.
                                  Oh dear God, no.
                              I call the basement.
                                         All done.

 What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we ...
               Use only in a well ventilated area.
                                  Shove it, buddy.
                                          Nothing.
                                             Okay.
                                           Y'ello.
                                           Y'ello?
    He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
          Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!
 We'll call you back! Bart! With ten thousand d...
                            Lisa, go to your room.
                                              Wee!
              Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore.
 Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory ...
                          What's he yelling about?
 Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move i...

                                          Shut up.
                                       Plants, eh?
             Hey, any more arboretums around here?
   That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!
                                 Grooming him, eh?
  I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.
                            Hey, what's with them?
 Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. "Chain for...
 Well these bills'll have to be paid out of you...
              Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
                           For the ninth time, no!
             Wait a minute, this gives me an idea.

          Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
     What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?
                                 He likes peanuts.
 I only have two questions. How much, and give ...
                             So, your bid is zero.
                                        Thank you.
                                        Thank you.
 Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less like...
    Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant.
                                             Done.
                                  Here's the keys.
                        I'll just keep these then.
                                 He took Bart too?
 That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That...
 Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the...

 Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of ...
                                 I'd like it fine.
 Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that...
                                              Huh?
 Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can strugg...
         Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...
 I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this...
 Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stamp...
 On the other hand, who's to say what's right t...
 All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to t...
                                     Mmm. Caramel.
         Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.
                           Woo hoo! What do I get?
                                          Woo hoo!
 Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, ...
             That's it, boy. You're our last hope.
 Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. J...
                         Oooh. He card reads good.
                               It's KURNS, stupid!
                                        Disregard.
 The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in t...

 Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the man...
 Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shap...
                                              Boo!
                              Oh, yeah. So good...
              Yeah, let's push him down the steps.
 How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spen...
 Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wea...
 That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusi...
                                 Bart, you listen.
                                  My secret shame.
                         Bart, you're coming home.
 Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees?...
                He locked the door! I'll show him.
          You idiot! He was the most talented one!
                  Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?
             Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!
                               I'll miss you, son.
 Son, I know you're upset because you thought y...
 Because one of them hung out with me for a wee...
                        Right back atcha, son. Aw.

 Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh...
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this ...
                            Well, I'm off to work.
 But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement.
 Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right,...
                     How many "s"'s in "innocent"?
                                     That is true.
         I can't let the boy see me skipping work.
                               How do you do, sir?
                                           Sucker.

                                              Huh?
                                        All right.
                                       Okay, fine.
                       What does sequestered mean?
                        What does deadlocked mean?
                                 Uh-huh. And "if"?
 So "if" we don't all vote the same way, we'll ...
 Where we'll get... a free room, free food, fre...

                                          Shut up.
 Jump, Free Willy, jump! Jump with all your might!
             I don't like this new director's cut.
                                     Got it, Barn?
 I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take...
                                         Souvenir.
 Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was aga...
          Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it.
              Maggie, can you point to the monkey?
                        Pfft. What do babies know?
           What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.
                                              Ooh.
                       Or, if not then, Christmas.
                Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny.
 Marge, please. Old people don't need companion...
                                               Oh.
                                       Not at all.

 Hey, Barney, why don't you fill out the groom'...
   Whew. Don't try to eat these so-called "chips."
                   Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.
                                  I mean, woo hoo!
                                   I was bluffing.
                       How dare you call me that?!
 So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, r...

 Oh, and how is "education" supposed to make me...
                                          And how.
 Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class....
 That's it! If he can teach a class, he can tea...
 Well... I can tell the difference between butt...

 That depends. Is there another way to get this...
 Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've s...
     Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets.
                     Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher.
 Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to ...
 Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!
                    It's all right! I'm a teacher.
 All right, the first thing they told me to do ...
                       Down the hall, room twelve.
                      Ew. Okay, let's get started.
                                       No talking.
 Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how ...
           Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny.

 Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!
                        Bees are on the what, now?

   Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
      Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!
   There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?
                                             Hmmm.

                                               Hi.
                                         Gotta go.
 I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
                                     I mean hello!
 That's okay. I'll just push the button for the...
                                    That's unsexy.
                                               Ew.
                           Well, this is my floor.
                              See you tomorrow....
 I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nu...
 Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm ...
       Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.
                                               Oh!
                                       Go to hell!
              I was doing my best to resist her...
 But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom.
                                       Yeah, yeah.
 Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have...
                 Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
                             But they're so sweet.
                                         Oh, baby.
  She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
 Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Loo...
             Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
       All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!
                                            Marge?
                                             Sure.
                                          Who? Oh.

               Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?
             The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge.

                Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.
                          It was, Marge. Admit it.
         Oh good, here comes the collection plate.
       We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed.

                            No, wait! I love Lisa!

                                     I don't know.

          Now, this is going to take all my skill.
                       Run, Marge! Save the booty!
                      See you in hell, candy boys.
 Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in ...
           See, she's having the time of her life.

 That's right, we all thought it was hilarious....
                 Well, that's kind of a gray area.
                                     Thanks, kids.

                       It's okay, they're with me.
 They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, ...

                           Not with that attitude.
 It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothin' ever blows...
                         Hey, that's a half truth.
                                             Whaa?
     Ooh, "Portrait!" Sounds classy... doesn't it?
               I don't have a friend in the world.
                        Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.
                                     I need a hug.
                      How come you guys hesitated?
             Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
                           Are you hugging the TV?

                                        Thank you!
                                You're both right.
                                              Huh?
                        And Ted Koppel is a robot.
                             Oh, that man is sick!
               But listen to the music. He's evil!
      Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.
                          Let's never fight again.
 Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of ...

                                    Oh. All right.
              Hey, Marge! This guy looks like Apu!
          Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in...
             Oooh. "Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."
  N -- -- yes. But please don't you say that word.
        Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck.

              Oh, here we are. The "Utility Room."
 No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine ...
              Never mind. You wouldn't understand.
                                               No.
                                               No.
                                               No.

                             We're both screw-ups.
          So are you gonna say something nice now?
                                          Aw, Dad.

 Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out ...
                                  I'm not ashamed.
               How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?
           I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!
                 Forty seconds? But I want it now.
   Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?
                             Hi, is Milhouse home?
                                 Mmm. Sounds good.
             Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!
                             And he knows my name.
 Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe...
                                    Run, boy! Run!

                                               No.
                                  That's the plan.
 Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is...
                       It was good, but not great.
                    Come on, eat the can. Come on.
                              Out of the way, you.
                                              Aww.

 Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh...
                     Oh, I want trouble all right.
                     No, you're gonna get trouble.
           Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
                                    Trouble it is.

      I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns.
                                            Uh-oh.
            Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother.
 Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say ...
           You really blew it this time, Smithers.
                                             Okay.

                       Which one's Itchy? The car?
                  Oh. I guess that's not him then.
     Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.
             All right... Wait a minute. For what?
                                        Forget it.

 All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All rig...
                    Then I can just push him over.
                                           No one.
                                            Never.
                                          Nothing.

                           Ooh, let's pick him up!
 And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.
                                   Oh, yes we are!
                                Oh, yes, there is!
 And I think it's the best idea I've ever had! ...
                         He made fun of my weight.
 Hey, you're that hitchhiker! What are you doin...
                          Wow, that's really lazy.

  No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.
  Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something.
                              Do I have to sit up?
                               Knock yourself out.

                        Thanks for introducing me.
                What the hell is wrong with you?!!
                                         For what?
                         I don't wanna go to that.
        That doesn't sound like something I'd say.

        Really? You were? But how did you find me?
      Or that little guy on the "Don't Walk" sign.
 Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, ...

             Good work, son! We did it! We did it!
  Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape!
 Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have...
  Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.
                                          Uh, yes.
                           This interview is over!
 Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any "...

 I had a feeling things would work out for you,...
                                      Thanks, Moe.
                    Yeah, my wife is raking it in.
          Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?
 You mean the mob only did me a favor to get so...
                              In those words? Yes.
 How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart ...
                          So what are we gonna do?
                  Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa.
                                         Now what?
                     You heard her. She said "no."
 But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anythin...
 Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you ...
 You must hate me, Marge. Every time I try to h...
                       Hey, that's the fire alarm!
                         I think I won, Mr. Burns.
                                          Woo hoo!
                    Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!
 So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupi...
                                              Huh?
 Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I w...
                                Well, here we are.
       Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
                                Uh, I lost my map.
                        Hey, this sounds like fun.
                                             Oooh.
                                  Uh, not as such.
                            Yes, lotta hysteria...
                Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!
       Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns.
                                 No sir. I am not.
                            That worked sooo well.
               No going through the window for us!
 You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I ...
            Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs.
 Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit li...
 Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tin...
                                               Oh?
                         Use it wisely, my friend.
                                You got it, buddy.
                    Um, I don't see one. Unless...
                           No. There's no way out.
                             You can supervise me.
                                      We sure did!
 I think when we yelled we caused another avala...
           Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .
                        I think they've stopped. .
                                          So what?
             It could be days before they find us.
                           We could build snowmen.
                                       Oh... Okay.
   Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!
                                           Agreed.
              Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns.
                                    What do we do?
                                You and what army?
                                          Burnsie!
 Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who...
                                      Marge, kids.
                           You said it, ya weirdo.
                             Marge, get me a beer.
 Your mother seems really upset about something...
           Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers.
                                              Eww.
 Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball ...
 Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.

                                      Gimme those.
                                            Sorry.
                                       I like him!
   I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.
                  You have my undivided attention.
                     MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.
          AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--

                                    Well, so am I.
 Okay. Question two -- who was your last employer?
                           Marge, do we know them?
 Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The b...
             Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?
                                Ooh, she is tough.
            I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.
                               Come to bed, Marge.
                              No, no. Leave it in.
                          NOT TILL YOU'RE FIFTEEN.
    Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding.
 Blood, uch! I'll just stick to the brain and k...

 You'll find it's even more fun if you get it f...
                              Oh, that poor woman.
                                             Nope.
                                      Indubitably!
 AROUND THE HOUSE, I NEVER LIFT A FINGER / AS A...
                                SHUT UP, FLANDERS.
                          I'm sure we will, honey.
                                 I'm sure we will.
 Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open castin...
                                         I do not!
                I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
 Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' "Howdy" to a...
 Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't so...
           Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog.
 Oh, "no attitude," eh? Not "in-your-face," huh...
        Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.
 Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, ...
        Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you.
 She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wa...
                           You? But you're a lady.
 Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so ...
                             You mean "meep meep"?
 Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air ...
 I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question...
              What the hell are you talking about?
                  Quiet! You're missing the jokes!
                   Well? What did everybody think?
                       So it was pretty okay, huh?
              Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?
                       I'm the worst Poochie ever.
  Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!
 You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm no...
                            Put a sock in it, Roy.
                                      No I am not.
                                            Never!
 You can't just kill off a classic TV character...
 Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I kno...
 Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie....
 Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those fin...
 Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing i...
 Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip ...
             Aw, nuts. Hel-lo? China? Little help?
                                  That is so true.
                                    What happened?
         Give her a break! Her husband was killed!
 Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, bu...
      Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.
 No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graph...
                 Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies.
            And that kind of stuff is worth money?
 Man, you should come over to our place. It's f...
 I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock?...
                                    Do I know you?
                             Ow! Why you little...
 Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a ...
           So, do those records have "camp value?"
 That John is the greatest guy in the world. We...
 Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lot...
             Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
                                      Who doesn't?
                                          Right...
 OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced w...
 Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property value...
 Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but ...
 You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV...
                             No! No, no, no, no...
 No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this hous...
 How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened!...
                                  Oh, and I'm not.
                 Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?
                                       Uhh... huh.
      Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!
 There's only two kinds of guys who wear those ...
 Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is a...
                         You! I should have known!
 Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy...
                                               No.
 You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there ...
 No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! Th...
 Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent "you ...
                                 Homer storms out.
 Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight...
 Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places...
 Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll al...
 ... as a father! A father!! A regular father!!...
                  Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
        Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?
 That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. Wha...
 Okay, that didn't work. But I know something t...
 Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's...
 Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us...
            You'll thank me on your wedding night.
                  Has the whole world gone insane?
 I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all ...
 Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole ...
                 Oh, my God, what's happening now?
             ...and the entire steel mill was gay!
 But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You ...
                                      Hunting, eh?
 Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hu...
       Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?
             It just does! Name me one gay Indian!
 Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know abou...
 Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when ...
 No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You'...
      That is a very immature attitude, young man.
 Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed...
           Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian.
 No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been ...
  Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!
                     Yep, and it's your shot, son.
   C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?
 Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I tur...
        Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!
                                      Me too, son.
 Son, there comes a time in every father's life...
                                          UNNGHH!!
                 Just... my bones... and organs...
                                     What the -- ?
                     Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!
                                   It's a miracle!
                             I've been tenderized.
 Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you cal...
                                     Amen to that.
 Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion t...
                                  He said "tried"!
                           Oh, all those stairs...
 Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the on...
 And sure, he's probably so insane with rage th...
                      In a medium-security prison.
                       Unless he gets out somehow.
 Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many...
                 Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
                                         Lisa too?
 Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your di...
            Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!
 You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered...
       The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
 Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick ...
 Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, ...
                             I'll have to ask her.
    Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
 Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all t...
                       Can you see the pie stains?
 Take it like a man, boy. And do everything you...
 Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's pract...
 All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remem...
                                You've never been?
                Nah, I'm really more of a slacker.
 Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities...
          Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs.
 You know, honey, when I think of all the good ...
                          Did you see that, Marge?
           Don't laugh at me! I was once like you!
 What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved ...
 Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. Sh...
                          Give me the drugs, Lisa.
 It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm ...
 Oh, Moe, thank God you're here! We'd like to c...
    Look at me! I'm the Prime Minister of Ireland!
                               I'll come with you.
 Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother...
 Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and...
        Glad you're finally back in business, Moe.
 At first I thought prohibition was a good thin...
                                               No.
 Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. ...
                  Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do...
                      C'mon, boy, think of a plan.
                                      I've got it!
 We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back,...
 Right. Now remember, don't mention this to any...
                     Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope.
                                     Hang on, son!
                             Really? I heard good.
                                          Nothin'.
 Before! Before! You're living in the past, Mar...
          Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.
  Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!
                            Yeah, suck like a fox!
 You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging,...
 Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast...
 I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! O...
 Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill ...
                                              Huh?
 It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money ...
                                     No you won't.
                                            Won't.
 Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to...
                               Call me Beer Baron.
   But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!
 Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpe...
                                    "Make it," eh?
                       Forty-two bathtubs, please.
                                 I said forty-two!
 Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust la...
                    Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?
 Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have bee...
         Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear.
                                       What, dear?
                                        Ka-BLAMMO.
                                             Boom.
                               I'll be right back.

                        The guy who took your job.
 Hey, how would you like to show him up by beat...
                     You forgot one thing, Wiggum.
                 I filled the balls with a funnel.
          Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist...
                             Last time I help you.
    Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore.

 No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist ...
                              Crowds give him gas.

 There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you...

                                      Okay, Grimy!
                                              Huh?
                                Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

                         So how's it going, Grimy?
 I wish I had a nickel for every time I've hear...
              Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.

                   Okay. Do I have to do anything?
 Oh, I can't believe it. I've got an enemy. Me!...
                          No, I won't accept that.

                        That's not so disciplined.
                                          I guess.

       Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm...
  Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son.
                                   Or "crapweeds".
              Not if they were called "scumdrops".
                                      Fair enough.
              Okay, once more. Where are we going?
      And why are you and the old lady in the car?
                            And why is Marge here?
                                And why am I here?
                        And why are the kids here?
                           And why is Grampa here?

                                 Get the hell out.

                                   What, Flanders.

 So what do you like, Lisa? Viomalin... tubamab...
                                 Ohh! Saxomophone.
                              Two hundred dollars!
                                 Oh, I'll take it.
  Yeah. "To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves ."

                             Why -- oh, I give up.
                        I learned from the master.
                 Lisa! Enough saxomophone already!
                                     Stupid hippo.
                                      Stupid frog.
                    Relax, I built a bomb shelter.
                          Fine, then don't use it.
                                             Good.
                                          So do I.
                                    You should be.

                                   You're mutants?
                    You want me? Come and get me!!
                                  A c... a coffin!
                       Die, you chalk-faced goons!
                               Go to hell, cloaky!
                                     Safe at last.
                   That better not be the mutants.
                        Marge! Kids! You're alive!
                                     Ohh, com'ere.
                   Now that's the Marge I married.
             So, who wants to steal some Ferraris?
 Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, every...

 This mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a...
                               Good night, losers!
             Man, how'd I live without this thing?
                              Oh, man that's good.
 Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated do...
                               It was your mother.

 So then Lenny says, "As if! Don't even go ther...
                         Yeah, well Lenny said it.
                      Eh, it'll turn up somewhere.
                Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart.
   Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!
                                   Nice work, son.
                 Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.
 Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all to...
     Something I should have done a long time ago.
           I'll teach you to mess with my machine!
                          I'm gonna chop you good!
                            That cost me 35 cents!
 You're just making it worse. I promise I won't...
          That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa.
                 Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.
           They're in my hair! They're in my hair!
 C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you'r...
                                    She's a witch!
                                     I don't know.
             Oh, I've never heard of those people.
                                          Woo hoo!
                             Yes, yes, oh God yes!
     Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win.
                                          Bo-ring!
                Oh, but I want to do some rioting.
                                         All done.
       I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please.
 Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here,...
                            Watch the fish, Marge.
                       What did I tell you, Marge?
                               Oh, let's get that.
            Let's get that! The suffocation thing!
                  Five hundred dollars! Forget it.
 I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we...
 I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve p...
          I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.
                                         Oh, yeah.
                                             Baby.
                                          Mmm-hmm.
                                              Ahh.
                    Ooo, I like the sound of that.
 Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Jus...
                       Five days! But I'm mad now!
                     I'd kill you if I had my gun.
 Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's...

                                 Former President.
                            Potentially dangerous?
                                          Woo hoo!
 Close your eyes Marge, I've got a surprise for...
                             Okay. Open your eyes!

 You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't ...
                                  All right, then.
 A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Lik...

                                            Sorry.

                                       Or would I?
             I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.
 All right, put your... Oh well, I'll rob it ne...
                                Sure thing, honey.
                  You want me to get the cat down?
                    See you in hell, dinner plate.
 Mmm, you probably left them at work. On anothe...
                     You said the breakfast table.

                    Oops, guess it already was on.
                  Uh. I'd better just put it down.
            All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you.
                          And I'm a wonderful man.
                Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.
 I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what ...
 But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you...
 So this is the thanks I get for protecting my ...
     Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!
                       They're here! They're here!
    Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.
                          Anyone else want a beer?
 I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
                                      Yeah, but...
                             I didn't get one yet.
 This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids....
               This stinks. I want my family back.
            Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?
                                            Sorry.

                                            O-kay!
                        Oh-ho, confused, would we?
 Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's ...
 It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized,...
                                  Freeze, bad guy!
 I know I said that, but what I secretly meant ...
 The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets i...

 There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt...
                                Then it's settled.
 Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this tea...
 Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an id...
                                         Fun, too.
   Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!
 Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's ...
 Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at ...

     Then why are you running the obstacle course?
                                 You never use it.

                                            Do it.
 Well, if you know a better way for me to live ...
             I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?
                   My father never believed in me.

 Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it...
       It's okay, son. You'll do better next time.
                                   Look at him go!
 Exx-cellent poise, son. You panicked, but you ...
 Great debut, son. You really settled in after ...
   Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?

 Okay. Half of you vibrate that way, two of you...
      Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?
                                Are you sure, son?
                      I knew I could count on you.

       Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart.
 Boy, I guess I was wrong about that earring. I...
                            I don't think so, son.
                                               No.
                                  Ask your mother.
                                               No.
                              Maybe for Christmas.
            Oh, will this horrible year never end?
 Will you look at those morons? I paid my taxes...

 No, because... You see I went ahead and... Yea...

 Shutup! Shutup! If I don't hear you, it's not ...
            Here you go. Keep using nuclear power.
 Okay, Marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-ho...
              If I don't see it, it's not illegal!
                                 Oh, no you don't!
                        C'mon, get in there. Drop.
                                          Woo hoo!

                                   Help! Somebody!
 No, sir. I'm really sorry sir. An older boy to...
 No sir, please. I can't go to prison. They pee...
                     No, please, I'll do anything!
                       I'm very happy to meet you.
 Okay, but could you pay me under the table? I ...
              Not spy, squeal. I've got no choice.
 Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this gove...
                       Does this make me look fat?
                                      But not fat.
 So if my cover gets blown and I need help, wha...
 Hey, I see you're watchin' the ball game. Look...
    How 'bout you, Lenny? Testing, testing? Lenny?
 Maybe. But first I need to hear about some oth...
             Uhhhh, like those. But involving you.
         Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.
     Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. End transmission.
                Well, I'm just glad it's all over.
 Why do you keep picking on me? Marge's name wa...
               Walk? That wasn't part of the deal.

 Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind o...
                                       Still cold.
         Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
  C'mon... Where are you?... Here, Trilly, Trilly.
                       Uhmmmm... Errr... Uhhhhh...
                       Uh, yeah, sure. That thing.
                           No you don't. Heh, heh.
                                             Ewww!
                                   Is that a fish?
                     Hey, that guy looks like you.
     Is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
              Wowww, that must be worth a fortune.
                                Hey, he's right...
 I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.
                             Take that, Uncle Sam!

                                              Yes!
                                 I call President!
 Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge. There...
                                 Nice to meet you.
                                    I had no idea.
 Mr. Burns, I think we can trust the President ...

                      Do they do any other tricks?
                             Just the monkey then.
     Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy.
 Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right ...
                    Mind if I take him for a ride?
                           There a problem, honey?

                                Can he get a duck?
                           Come on. Come to Poppa.

                                        And so on.
                     Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?
 What do you want? His cholesterol's through th...
 No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge you...

                                          I guess.
                                          Kiss it.
                                   Oh-ho yeahhh...
       Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime.
                              Crap -- py -- stuff.
       Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled.

 Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world...
 I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's...

                                 Oh, where is she?
                   Has anyone seen my little girl?
              For God's sakes, my little girl is--
                                            Hello.
                  I am at work. This is what I do.
  Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot.
                      Uh, yes sir, Mr. Burns, sir.
        Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?
                                   Lisa... Lisa...
       This is no good. I've got to get up higher.
                        Give me all your balloons.
                              I hope this works...
 These are for you if you let me use your cherr...
                                 Lisa? Lisa? Lisa!
          Stay there! I'll come down and save you!
                                    Lisa! Save me!
        Oh, no! I'm gonna go off the end of the --
 I'm not normally a praying man, but if you're ...
                  Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay!
                                  Ow! Ow! Ow! Oww!
                       Nah, I'll just walk it off.
                              Don't ever say that.

                         Uh... not this exquisite.
                   Well, Daddy will figure it out.
 Lisa, you can't go this far and then not go fu...
                           Oh, so now it's we, eh.

 Yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'l...

                                              Run!
   Look, honey, I clipped on my tie all by myself.
                     Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge.
 Hey, look what was in here. A program from tha...
         Yeah, him. Whatever happened to that guy?
 But Marge, the Gilded Truffle is an intimate, ...
 You mean there's been cake in our freezer for ...
 Hey Marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had li...

 Another super year with a super lady. Good nig...
         You know, um, it is a special occasion...
                 Yeah. Seems like the thing to do.
                                  So, you gonna...
   Oh. No. No, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to, uh...
         I know, but let me get you started first.
                            All right. How's that?
                                        Oh, sorry.
                           Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
                            No, no. Don't do that.
                      I know, but I don't like it.
                                              Ahh!
                                  Look who's here!
                                He's the best boy!
 Hey, Marge, wasn't that great when the dog cam...
                                  I love that dog.
                                          G'night.
                                Hmm, that's queer.
                                             What?
                                         The food!
                    Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?
                                             Okay.
 It was just the shock of seeing all that food ...
           Eh, I never thought I'd live this long.
 I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonn...
                                           Hmmm...
 When you think about it, mud is nothing but we...
 Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these far...
                                   That was close!
                          At your service, milady.
                                       Cara mia...
         Bart, I told you not to leave that TV on.
              No, no, honey. Maybe this will help.
 Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the week...
 Nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex...
        Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?
 If there's anything more exquisite than Queen ...
       Are you ready to rock? 'Cause heeere we go!
                     Um, no time like the present.
                              Well, yeah, kinda...

           They didn't hear us in the sewing room.
                                 Hello, everybody.
                                        Bart! Yes.
                              Awww... Eskimo kiss!
   I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.
             Not yet. Wait... wait... wait... now!
 It hasn't changed since that magical evening w...
      Yeah, I thought Bart would be born a dimwit.
    Well, this time I'm drunk on love... and beer.
             Oh, why can't they just play through?
     Ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?
    Marge, can we trade? I don't trust these guys.
       Y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--
                                             Okay!
       Gil! Thank God it's you. You gotta help us.
               Honey, my shoulders are separating.
 Oh, we're surrounded, Marge. Maybe we should g...
 Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field d...
                     Grab onto the handles, Marge.
 Okay, I think I've figured this thing out. It ...
                              These have pleats...
 I'm okay, honey. Now listen very carefully. I ...
                       No, that was not the thing.
                                      Thank you...
 Marge, uh, can we not land here?... Honey?... ...
    Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.
                                  Dads especially!
 Scary ways. But we never intended it to end li...

 And I get my money from grease. What's the pro...
 Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if we'r...
 Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this ...

        Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?
 Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There...

 Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out...

 Outta the way. This is one invention you're no...

               Look, son. Edison was just like me.
 No! We both lived in another man's shadow. Thi...
 We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dream...
 No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum ...
  Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney.

                            I needed my power fix.
   Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward.
 Man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooo...
                    Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!
                     Stand back and watch the pro.
                        Nah. They mess up my hair.

 Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur.

 The chair? How come they only do crucifixions ...
    Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!
                             This is legal, right?
            Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
                               Later, chickie-pie.
                         You sent me to the chair.
                    I know you are, but what am I?
                        It's hammer time, Snitchy.
                                       Oh, my God!
 Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna...

     There. Now no murderers can get in... or out.
                                You are sooo dead.
                           Come here, you little--
          Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!
                 But I look so youthful and hunky.
                              The kid's gotta die.
                                But I love my son.
                    More than a lush head of hair?
                             Don't make me choose!
                                           Nooooo!
                                  I love you, son.
                              I'll show you, hair!

                      Do we have to listen to you?
                                         I'm done.
     Hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!
       Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!
                                              Duh.
 What the heck is this, a tea party? Somebody k...
            But it's funny, Marge. The guy's sick.
 Oh, we've gotta get home. I don't wanna miss, ...
                                F. Murray Abraham.
          Can't stop now. We're making great time.
                          What are you, an animal?
 Whoever keeps saying "please stop" back there,...
                   Wow, get a load of that toilet.
 We're almost home, Dad. Only a couple more tim...

   So... you're saying I don't need a new muffler?
                      Oh, I blame myself for this.
 C'mon, Doc. There's gotta be something I can d...

 Ahhh. I'm the luckiest man in the world, now t...
 It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it...
                 Really? You think it's dangerous?
                      Procedure. Deadly procedure.
               Now you're just tryin' to scare me.
                            But I don't want that.
                                    Yeah, I guess.
 Well, actually I-- Hey! Quit harvesting me wit...

 I owe Dad so much. Those bedtime stories began...
 You're right, Marge. I'll do it. But if I die ...
                             Blow up the hospital.
                                   That's my girl.

                                  I love you, Dad.
    I'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
        Even those guys look too civilized for me.
 I could live at sea! The sea forgives all. Not...
             Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
 Uh, excuse me, I'm fleeing in shame and I'd li...

      Oh, I like taffy, but I don't deserve taffy.
                  A tramp steamer! That's perfect!
 Oh, I'd like to apply for a job. Any job. If y...
            I've been on that one. The taffy shop.
           The name on the back says "Honeybunch."
                        Well, actually, you did...
                            Say, who are you guys?
                    H-Heyy, let me off this thing.
                                             Whew.
                                      Forget what?
 Well, back on land, my name was Homer Simpson....
                             Well, yeah, I know...
 That's the last time I trust the strangest peo...
                    Even the sea won't forgive me.
 Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship wit...
 All right, this is it. No more living in shame...
                           All right, I'm gonna...
                               No you're not, Dad.
 I'm sorry, Dad. The way I behaved was shameful...
                                      Boy, that...
                                               Ow!
 I'm sorry I ran off again. Oh, I guess Dad mus...
                    It's a miracle! You recovered!
                                  What? What? Hey!
     You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--
 Don't you dance out that door you... I'll get ...
          Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug.

                                           Hmmm...
                                  Yesss, tickling.
 Well, I'd rather get a message than see anothe...
                                 Well, beats work.

 Homer Simpson -- nerd buster. And I'm gettin' ...
                                            Never!

 Oh, how was I supposed to know it's not a real...
                        Forget Maggie! She's gone!
 Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted yo...
                                          Woo hoo!
                                I said, "woo hoo."
                              Even during Ramadan?
                                              Wha?
                                             Nooo!
                                            Clear!
                           The pig is in the poke.
                             Look out, Marge! Cat!
                   Hold it! What's your clearance?
                                    Access denied.
                  They'll be fine in half an hour.
  Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well...
  It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir.

            So, how'd you get the nickname "Legs"?
                               Oooh, mini-cannoli!
 Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back ...
         Milking room? I hope you cows are decent.
                             Oh! Crap on a crutch!
              They're milking rats! Milk-ing rats!
                                         Bart, no!
                        Oh, get that away from me!
 Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk....
                                          Go nuts.
 You... monster! How could you do that to the c...
 And to think, I respected you! And defended yo...
                         Okay, we'll call it even.
 Oh my God, I killed the mayor. All right, stay...
              His corpse is climbing the building!

 Relax, you're in good hands. Now come on, I'll...
 Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad. Oh, what are you...
 Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already ...
 It's my duty, Marge. Besides, those mobsters d...
             What? There's nothing to worry about.
                 All right, fine. I'll take a cab.
 Oh, I get it. You're worried about those mobst...
 You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm...
                                  Uh, excuse me...
                Do you have a table for the mayor?
                         Why do you talk that way?
 Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... ...
 All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quim...
       Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this--
        Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right.

                                 Gimme that knife!
                                       The force?!
                                               Oh.
                                     Oh, Fat Tony.
 Ohh, I'd say you were luminous, magnetic, inca...
             Really? Would you say I was magnetic?
                                            Aww...
                          Get out of the way you--
                Oh, I can explain that. You see...
                    Don Rickles zinged you, Marge.
                                Eat my dust, dust!
      Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week.
         Really? You think I should get it washed?
                                Hey, that's great.
                                        Wuss rock?

                                  All right, Bart!
                                 Fire in the hole!
                           Okay, no more gasoline.
                                       Full power!
  You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart!

                Eh, the Missus will clean that up.
 First of all, I get five dollars a day plus ex...

            Well that's unfortunate. It really is.
 Congratulations! Welcome to the Homer Simpson ...
 One day soon I will come for you, and then the...
                                       Gimme that!
       That's your problem. You're living up here.
                         You gotta live down here.
 In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me...
 We're going to break the bank at the Monty Bur...
                                    You mean Lisa?

                                           Sucker.
                                 I don't think so.
   I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
                               Hey! Lance Murdock!
        He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death.
                Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him!
           Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out. This isn...

              Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please.
                                 And for you, Ned?
                              Welcome to my world.
                                     The what now?
                  Well, of course a-- Who are you?
                       Hey, smooth move, Flanders!
                                            Eeech.
 Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay.....
                     Ned, no! Think of your wives!
 Wait a minute. This could be some kind of scam...
                           Ahh, precious memories.
                             What did you call me?
                        Sure. Sock it to me, baby.
                                   We are so dead.
 Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. So ...
 But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear...
      Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie.
  Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.
 I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could...
 Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig. Ch...
        I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping.
                              Ooh, a friendly bee.
                                               Ow!
 Ow, that sting hurt so much. We gotta get outt...
 Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill...
       Oh, those awful women want their omelettes.
                         Ginger throws Ned a kiss.
                                           A lion!
                                  The Moody Blues!
       What if we switched wives? Would that help?
                    Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom.

 All right, let's get our stories straight for ...
                    Because we love them, Jackass.
 Anyhoo, we came out of Walmart, when suddenly ...
 You're right, you're right. Fifty spaceships, ...

 Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause th...

                     I'm going to warm up the car.
                                    And it sucked!
                  "HITLER IS A JERK, MUSSOLINI..."
                              NOW IT DOESN'T WORK.
                          So, who won? The losers?
                                           Losers.
 You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that...

                                      Woo! Rumaki!
                                Isotoooopes! Wooo!
                 Hey, a baseball field! Batter up!
                                        Touchdown!
                                             Safe!
                                   Whoop! Careful.
                                       Last night?
                                Hello, big Maggie.
 Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time...
 Oh, my God! Look what those rotten kids did to...

   Well, turn something on. I'm starting to think.

                                 I have a problem.
           Well, at least they've already done me.
 Oh, I hope they don't reveal this is a comb-over.

                                               No.
                                           Really?
     Oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?
 No! Wait! This is all my fault! Oh, if I could...

 Yes! Now that Lenny's in, Carl will fall like ...
     Yeah, yeah. Do we have any pencils that work?
                          Yeah, it's a good group.
     Aw, thank God! Now we can stop holding it in.
                                 What is it, Rudy?
                                 Hey, Troy Aikman!
 'Scuse me, comin' through. Friends of Dan Marino.
                             Okay, Dan. Fire away.

                                          Woo hoo!
                    We can still make the kickoff!
                                Let us outta here!
 Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, clea...

  Ow! Oh! All right, Lovejoy! You're gonna get it.
      But this might be my last chance to win one.
           Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.
                                         What one?
                                             Door?

                          He's named like my name!
 Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly...

               And that's the end of that chapter.
                   All right. And what's the name?
                      Take it or leave it... Carl.
 Mmm, who knows? Maybe I'll have to foil an ass...
                     Yup. Right down to the scarf.
 Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Sim...
 No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just a...
    Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!
                            Gentlemen, I bid you--
                     Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa!
 I can't understand what happened. Why did they...
    That does it! There's only one thing I can do.
        I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
 Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, b...
 People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get ou...
           Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home.
                             Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's.
                  C'mon, people. Enough is enough.
                                             Okay.
 The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat...
                       And that big yellow flower.
 Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, ...
                                     Yeah. "Bart."

                                Dynamic, isn't it?
 That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, ...
                                     Yes, briefly.
 Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off.
 Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap your...

                        Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power.
        Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer.
           Yeah, but I usually have three or four.
                         Tie good. You like shirt?
 Marge, this is Thai food. From now on, I want ...
                  When Trent Steel bought me some.
       He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.
                       Oh, I spit my gum in there.
 No way, this guy's a winner. He has a company ...
                              For all of us. Look.

          Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!
    Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
                 Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!
  What's going on, Trent? Where are you taking me?
                 Oh, this is the worst party ever.
 Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on ...
          Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.
 That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy ge...

                           Right after Happy Hour!
      So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?
                                             What?

                             Roses. So many roses.
                                            Roses.
  Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!

                             And that's it, right?
                 But that's not for awhile, right?

                           Ah, give me a minute...
                          Oh, Marge, you saved me!
          Is there anything that guy doesn't know?
                               Oh, I'm sure of it!

        That's no way to address Sir Drinks-A-Lot.
                                             Okay.
   Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?
                                      Well, Marge?
               What's your favorite radio station?
                 Hey, that's super! See you later.
   Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad.
                            They know I'm kidding.

     Finally, a company that understands my needs.
                               So we're even then?
                        It's called caring, Marge.
 Ya gotta admit, Marge, that's a lot more roaming.

                                       Bye, Marge!
                         Aren't you gonna say bye?
              That didn't sound like you meant it.
            That's more like it. So long, suckers!

   We shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
          Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel.
 How did the country lose its way, Mel? When di...
 Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling...
 Hey, what about a prequel to something? Everyb...

                             Hey, Mel. I fell out.
             Thank you for getting me out of work.
             Yeah, he's somethin' else, all right.
                        Hey, that looks like Bart.
                        Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer.
                                 What? Time to go?
                                        Candy bar?
        I'd say he's coming out of the Pep Closet.
                        They become your slaves...
                      It's all about trust, honey.
 Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
 Sure you do. All your favorite stars have used...
                                      Andy Dick...
                        Yeah, and I'm a size four.

                                               Ow!
 Geez, what's the big deal? Look, I'll even eat...
                                             Now--
                          Way to guilt him, Marge!
                                  Do I get a card?
         Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...
 Well, I have been thinking about making them i...

 You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment ...
                       Got my whole week in there.
 Oh, this thing'll do anything. Watch, I'll ask...

                                      Oh... Marge!
                  Really? With butterscotch on it?
 Marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ...
      That was fun. We have to get out more often.
                         Well, sure, if it's true.
                    Ray J. funny... or O.J. funny?
                                        Even mine?
                  Hey, I had Lenny's name on that!
                Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!
              Hey, you found my needlenose pliers.
                                   Wake up, honey!
 He quit blinking. He says that's when they get...
                           After we trusted you...
         Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna have a tummyache.
                  Hey, there was just air in mine.
 We should have paid more attention to these si...
        But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?

                Why don't you just tell everybody?
                     The frame store! You monster!
     And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.
              Who cares? That man can really slug.
     Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy's got it covered.
                      God bless you, Nelson Muntz.
         Hey, you , you cut me off! Ah, yeah, you!

             If he's so smart, how come he's dead?
                       Ooo... pointless nostalgia.
                          I'd sure hate to be him.

                             What's wrong with it?
             It was so hard to get to 500 words...

                        Woo hoo! Stop the presses!
                          Okay, start the presses!
                       Whatever. I'll be at Moe's.

                                 For you, perhaps.
           I've given out my share of bad reviews.

                               Oh, that's classic.

   Are you crazy? A dog can't type. Unfortunately.
                                Really? Like what?
 Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me...
                      A bat! Now that's a new one.
                So what are you up to, young lady?
 Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doi...
                                       Pedestrian.
                                       Uninspired.
                                I didn't say stop!

                          Eh, I've had a good run.
                                            Noooo!
 Oh, Lisa... you saved me! And after all the ba...
 Oh, Lisa, the important thing is, I didn't get...
     I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!
                   Finally getting my comeuppance.

                               Aww, she missed it.
 Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having...
               And that's the end of that chapter.
 Try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.
 When I think about Ned, I can't help but remem...

                            We'll miss you, buddy.
 Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was ...
 You know, I've never liked that little wiener ...

                                      Who is this?
                                   No, it's Homer.
 Dear God, it's Homer. If you really love me, y...

                           Lisa, the pet cemetery.

 And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where ...
                   Now, Flanders, I want you to...
                           He's undead, all right.
        Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
 Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. ...
                              Flanders, stop that.
        Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?
               Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood.
                                       Absolutely.
                                   Doin' what now?
 That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be ...
                                            Uh-oh.
 Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed ...
                          Hey, this milk's broken.
                                         Stop! Ow!
                          I'm caught on something!
               But I was gonna loot you a present!
                       Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders?
                        Implied, Lisa? Or implode?
                           Thank you, sweet clown.
                        In death you saved us all.
           I can still hear his voice on the wind.
                Just like the dead clown promised.
                                        That's us!
 Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from ...

         And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!
            I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.
 You're right. I gotta let it go. All that coun...

           Tom Arnold?! What the hell's going on?!
                           So we're all gonna die?
       The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!
                           Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell.
             Ooo, you don't want to get Zorro mad.
                                  Not fast enough!
                         I have to go to ze lobby!
 You're not supposed to go to the bathroom with...
                                To the top please.
                                Swim, my pretties.
                                        Sh-sh-shh!
                               Woo! You go, Zorro!
        Why that little... He insulted your honor!
                       Sir, I demand satisfaction.
                        I challenge you to a duel.
              Will you duel, or are you a coward?!
                         Uh, uh. "H" is for Homer.
           Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean?
 No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted...
 I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel.
 Really? But you've never given anyone a free b...
 Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little...
                               BABY, GLOVE SLAP...
 Coming through... challenge... duel... Hi Lenn...
                                              Huh?
                                        Aisle six?
   Duelling at dawn? How did it ever come to this?
  Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?
                                               Oh.
 Oh, honey, I had the worst nightmare. This glo...
                         He's out there, isn't he?
                            Hey, I'm not dead yet.
                      Save me, Marge. I saved you!
     Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go.
    And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.
 Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southe...
 I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle...
                                     Ah, screw it.
                        Ooh! How 'bout that house?
                                  Lousy show-offs.
  Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum.
                                 Come on, move it!
                                How should I know?
  'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?
                                         Zo-rrooo!
 Rural route 9? That's it! We can hide out at t...

                                     Hello, kitty.
                                 You little scamp.
 Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpso...
        That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!
    All right, let's see what the old girl can do.
                                          Hang on.
                                     And... there.
                                Now we're talkin'!
                                    Go get Lassie.
                   This car was made in Guatemala.
                 I bought these shoes from a hobo.
            I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming.
                             Aw, what do you know?
                     Oh, that's just superstition.
      You watch me. I'll grow something out there.
           Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that.
                   Oh, a little bit of everything.
 Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless...
 And for those who face nature unafraid, it is ...
                             Move the handbrake...
                              Ohhh, that's heaven.
   Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?
                          I'm only one man, Marge.
              Oh, who am I kidding? I'm no farmer.
                    Leave me alone, you big bully.
 Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be...
 Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such...
                                    Wait a minute.
                      Easy... careful... steady...
        Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.
 Well, Marge, have you ever seen a field glow l...
 Of course not. But you know something? Sometim...

                                 Aw, thanks honey.
  Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?
 Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for ever...
              You're scaring the customers, honey.
                                             Okay.

                            Look, a flying saucer!
 There, there. We had quite a scare today. But ...

                                 I agree, but how?
                        They're after the tomacco!
   Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is...
                               No, I'd rather die!
                                          Take it!

 Nope. Nope. This would be a lot easier without...
                            Waldo, where are you?!
                           Oh sure. Single me out.
                                       Over there.
 Heh, heh. I'd hate to see the look on ol' Burn...
 Mmm, who is that? Big ugly nose... bald... liv...
    No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
                      Safe in the core. And now...

 Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on ...
                                What a rotten day!
                                           Really?

       Woo hoo! I'm ten pins away from perfection.
          Why won't they come over? I'm so lonely.
                     Get down, get down, get down!
     Woo hoo! This is the greatest day of my life!

                         Yes, Bart's weird friend.
             You've got a father. He's just a dud.
                                    Next question.
                Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on.

         Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again.
         That's right. You've got a special daddy.

                                          Mm-hmmm.

                                    I do what now?
 Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could us...
                    I can see I'm not needed here.

                  C'mon, Maggie. You can trust me.
                     Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!
 I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things bet...
              What are you pointing at? The ocean?
     That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.
 See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub....
       Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.
 And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy ca...
 Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink...
                             Maggie! Call Aquaman!
 Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me.
                               Oh, you do love me!
    Actually, that was before I went in the ocean.
                                       Then don't.
 Well, all I care about is that my little girl ...

 Up-bup-bup-bup! That's an Apu question. You're...
                   My mistake. Stay in the moment.
                        And that's my cue to exit.
 I just wanted to invite you to the wrap party....
        Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.
 Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they show...
                   Yeah. It looked just like that.
                      Mine tasted like strawberry.
                                Mmm... Ovulicious.
 Free baby cola? Apu hits the jackpot, and I'm ...
           I've been waiting so long to hear that.
 Ooh, look at that. Ooh, gingerbread house. Han...
                    Boy, that Hansel sure can eat.
                      My corneas! You were saying?
     Eight kids. Hm, I'm sterile, right baby doll?
                                        Beautiful.
 Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling ab...
               Marge... They've turned into jerks.
                                    No, Marge. No!
                      She's no Liza, but it works.
           Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.
                          There... and... there...
                      Okay, this is gettin' weird.
 Please, Mr. Kidkill, look into your heart. I k...
                                     Not any more!
  Okay, okay... don't panic. Release the mongoose!
 Stupid mongoose! get the snake! The snake! Do ...
                           What an age we live in.
                            I remember television!
                         Nah. We'll go next month.
 Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like...
                           What an age we live in.
 Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance fl...
                              That's right, never!
       Oh! I need a dance partner! What about you?
                                          Woo-hoo!
 It's mine. Finally, I've won the respect of my...
                          Promise you won't laugh?
                                 I don't know how.
                                Will you teach me?
                        A gang! That's the answer.
        Remember to rebel against authority, kids.
 Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying ...
                I know, I know. Just tune her out.
 Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' ...
              Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa.
 You know, if you want to be in the gang, event...
  This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos.

             How could I be down a thousand bucks?
                       And what if we don't, Pops?
                They printed my photo of our gang!
 Carl looks great. Can't take a bad picture of ...
 If you'd've been awake you would have said no....
 You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coinciden...
                                             Okay.

                                            Sorry.
                                             Done.

                                    I'll show you.
 Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there...
       Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn.
                      I guess I'll never find her.

           And the exits are sealed! Go to plan B!
                                          Come on!

           That's not true, he left it on the bus.
                                       Lisa, help!
                              I got the groceries!
                     It's the bread of astronauts.

              Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!

 Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? Oh, ...

                             What? I can see fine.
           That had nothing to do with the bucket.
                                 Cure me! Cure me!
              Yeah. And I got a bucket on my head!

                                It's not to scale.
                                  And chili fries!

                                      Who are you?
                    Everyone gets an award but me.
            Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?
             I mean an award that's worth winning.
                               What's that, sonny?
          Well, that was a great night for us all.
     Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
                    Look at me, I'm a billionaire!
 And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.
                           Wasteful AND practical.
   A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge.
                    Now I'm ready to hit the town.
                                        I'm drunk!

              Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge.
  Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party.
                               What about partays?
                                             Damn!

   Flanders? Since when do you like anything cool?
      Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes.
                                 Oh, I missed one!
                Let's go! New tires! C'mon, c'mon!
                 Oh, how rude of me. My name is...
                                           My bad.
                                          Finally!

                                Oooh, a bobby pin.
 And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodby...
                     I know. No more being a jerk.
                                          Finally.
     Quit hogging Flanders. I want to comfort him.
                Then I insist on walking you home.
 Those feelings are normal, Ned. They're part o...
 It's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkl...

 You want anything else? Water? Chili fries? Ho...

        What the... Oh, you want a rock fight, eh?
                              Okay, be right down.
 Yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd sa...
 Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the...
 But, uh, there's no point in playing the blame...

 Okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot...
     Then we star-wipe to Flanders brushing his...
        Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?

             And his own car? That's Ned Flanders.

                                Eh, it's hopeless.
                              Yeah, it's hopeless.

 Anything at all. You name it. What do you want...
                                      Stupid Lisa.
                                             okay.
                                           Idiots.
 Dear Lord, bless this humble meal, and did you...
 Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters. So, ...
            Okay, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey.
 Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy like ...

                              C'mon! Get in there!

                       I think we're in the clear.
                               I said I was sorry.
                  Sorry you're such jerks! Ha, ha!
                          Ow! That Bullet went in.
     You want money? Get a job, like your old man.
     So, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?
         I like your attitude. Take what you need.
                                No, of course not.

               Nooo! It was finger Ling-Ling good!
                  Well, what do you want, a medal?
                                         Love you.

         Just give the word, and I'll cut him off.
                                 Consider it done.
               Marge, your posture looks terrible.
                                     Yes, go on...

   Did you see Daddy dance? They all saw me dance.
     Yes. I humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
                                           I know.
     Maybe for you. How come you didn't rescue me?
   Well, you could treat me with a little respect.
                  You see, that's what I'm saying.
         Shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey.

                          I don't have a computer.
 That does it. I'm getting a computer! As soon ...
                                Oh. I'm so stupid.
                 Uh... I guess I'll take that one.

  I can't. My web page hasn't gotten a single hit.

                            Not even a little one?

 Stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car.

           I could ask you the very same question.
                                        Would you?

                 Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys.
    And how about that Stephanie the weather girl?
  Wow. How do you come up with such witty remarks?
                              Get off my property.
                     I've had it with that school!

                         I'll be right out, honey.
     Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.

 Too busy to reply, huh? I know how that goes. ...
                                         Per-fect.
           Well, I'm ready for the big tournament.
                                   Hey there, son!
 With that little outfit on, everyone's gonna t...
            It's gonna be tough without a partner.
                Well, good for you! Anyone I know?
                            Good morning, partner!
         The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.
                                     Yes, darling?
                No. No, no, no. You're my partner.
                                             Nooo!
                                         Traitors!
                                            Uh-oh.
                        I don't think they saw me.
                                     Hello, Marge.
         Hello, Bart. How are the tennis partners?
 Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.

                     I think you're underreacting.
                             This session's under.
                                           Badbye.
             No. No. Stay away from my wife, Bart.

                       Don't listen. It's a trick!
             I think he's trying to psych you out.
    Well, look who's here. You two are goin' down.
     Did you hear that? She said we're goin' down!
                            Oh, that's loser talk!
                                   Unbeatable, eh?
        Comin' through... Hey, hi Otto... Sorry...
 Hey, that's great. Listen, I need a new double...
          Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son.
            Hm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go!
                                    Booo! You rot!
                                        Up- bup...

 Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run acros...
                                             Yeah.
   Everybody's been dumped but me. I'm undumpable.
                                  My tennis stick!
                                      Who are you?
                  Which one am I? Serena or Venus?

                              Eh, bound to happen.
     Wowww... It just rolled over to ten thousand.
                      What did you just see, Lisa?
                            What did you just see?

                                  You have failed.
           By the way, what kind of blood is this?
              Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!
                           A hungry, hungry hippo!
                                    Help! Kitenge!
                                 Good ol' Kitenge.
         Quick! Into the river! Hippos hate water.
                                     It's working!
                                          Leeches!

                      This flower saved our lives.
                                     Not a chance.
                                    It's a flower.
 I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of th...
                                               Go.
                 Or... more mouthwatering monkeys.
                Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous!
           So, I notice your home smells of feces.
                 And not just monkey feces either.
       You must be the most boring woman on earth.

                 Anything for these noble animals.

                       Somebody light this monkey.
                                 Help! Bad monkey!
                      Look at me, I'm a scientist!
                                 What a nice lady.
          Hey, look! Our tour guide got a new job.
               I was wondering what became of him.
 Now he's just a stinking flight attendant! Hey...
                                        Breakfast!

    Well, let's put him to the test. Me love beer.
                                Aw, he loves beer.
                               Here, little fella.
        I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot.
                        Ooo, can I have a brownie?
                           Ooo, can I have dinner?
         Homer wants a brownie! I'm gonna get one!
                          Comin' in from the left.
                               Or is it the right?
                    Look out for the reach-around!
                     He shoots, he sco-- My thumb!
                             Oh God oh God oh God!
      Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!
           Reattach a thumb? This isn't "Gattaca."
                       Okay boy, drop the thumb...
                        Nobody's gonna tackle you.
                          Come back with my thumb!
 Come on! Come on, boy! Oh, please give it back...
                          I have nothing he wants.
                            Give me back my thumb!
                                              Gaa!
 Okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, y...
                                 Marge, over here.
                      But I have finger insurance!
                                     Symmetry, eh?
        We need more ice! My thumb is fading fast.
               Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb!
                                      Thanks, Moe.

                       Oh, why isn't this working?
                         Hey, thanks for stopping.
                           Oh, crap. It's on fire!
         Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?
    Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
                                    It's too late.

               Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb.
           Did you ever see that "Blue Man Group?"
                                  Abra-ca-thumbra.
    Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
                                 What the hell...?
                                     Linguo, dead!
               Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!
       One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven.
                                        To Heaven!
                               Christ be with you.
                                  Leave Ned alone.
 He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she...
                    Does -- Rachel -- like -- Ned?
       Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties.
                       Hey, she's coming this way!
    Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going.
           Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime.
                          He can hear you, Rachel.
    Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?
                      Yeah, maybe it was too soon.
              Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?
                            Say bye, Mr. Flanders.
                     Yeah, a lifetime of memories.

 Aw, what a beautiful frame. Perfect for my day...
                                           Umm-hm.
 Hang on, everybody. Three, two, one... Blast off!
                               Aw, that's my girl.
                           Is there a snack table?
                                  Don't film this.
     'Cause the thing is, there are no bad kids...
    Sorry. Daddy thought you were a pile of cable.
 My kids wear these hearts to remind them they ...
                 Yes, through the magic of caring.
                               I'll mace you good!
 Please let me win this, Lord. 'Cause if you do...
                                              Yes!
         All my love has come back in trophy form.
                                        I'll call.

                               Run, children! Run!
 Uh... For frosty chocolate milkshakes. Frosty ...
        I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
                                            Uh oh.
 Why did you rat me out, kids? Was it because I...
 Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two...
 Now let's all enjoy the snack table while we s...
                             Yeah, that'll happen.
                                        Teamsters.
               The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
  Hey, wait a minute. "Airport tax, five dollars?"
 Well, we are not boarding that plane unless yo...
                    Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.
                The Simpsons are ridin' the rails!
                      What are you gonna do to us?
                    Man, buffalo are easy to kill.
 All right, but your next story better be worth...
                              Oh, this'll be good.
                                         Whoopsie.
 A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for ...
 I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how...
              What have I done? What have I done?!
                                            Aww...
                                         Big deal.
          I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.
                      I'll meet you in Wilmington.
          Raise your arm... Okay, the other one...
 Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I...
                                              It--
                                               Ew!
 And it's important to feel good about yourself...
 Ah, Ethnictown. Where hard-working immigrants ...
                Wait, this is just a shaved puppy.
 The perfect crime. Marge, I have to be in cour...
 A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony...
      So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
                                            Beads!
                                             Owww!
                   Hey, that's me. And that's you.
                                        What-ever.
                          Are you coming on to me?
                                      Good as new.
           Well, I... There. Right as rain, there.
 Marge, that "curse" is just a lot of silly sup...
                            Guys, I am not cursed!
     Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!
                             When did that happen?
 Let's make sure he's a leprechaun. Sing us a s...
 Ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themse...

                                        Ew! Nasty!
          Yep. Everything worked out for the best.
   Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back.
                         She's not the boss of me.
                                 Mm, various eggs.
 Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant ...
                                      Oh, I agree.
                Yeah, that's the price of success.
                          What's my blood alcohol?
                                  Keep 'em comin'.
                                 Yeah, she's cool.

                                   Good ol' table.

                         Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
      Yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special...
                            My sweet little angel!
                     Hey, we stayed for your kids!
 WON'T YOU MARRY ME, BI-ILL? / I GOT THE WEDDIN...
            Didja hear that, Pengy? Forty dollars!
                            End of the line, boys.
                            I love our court days.
                  Judge Snyder? While we're young?
                        I'll bring the car around.
                    What'd she say about cupcakes?
 Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party P...
                 And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.
                                          Coooool.
 Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of "Don...
 I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of co...
                                         It won't?
                                        Tethered?!
                                       Room five?!
                              It's a little tight.
                                     I used to be.
                  Oh, this punishment is so cruel.
                              I'll medicate you...
 ...honey. You know, this could be fun. Race yo...
                                          Bo-ring.
 Come on, these kids are never gonna use that s...
                                             Fine.
                                           Cobras!
 Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything ...
                                            Swing!
         Run, Bart! Pump your thighs! Pump them...
                                I'm with you, son!
                                  That's my boy...
                                  C'mon, hug me...
                                   Cobras! Cobras!
 Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Owww! That really ...
 I thought I would hate working nights. But it'...
                                        Sure, boy.
 Oh, son. You know that's none of your business...
          Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes...
 Really. You like skateboards? We're sure learn...
                 Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer.
                               I hit my head, Moe.
                                       Since when?
              All right, all right. Come on, Bart.
                         That's my little slugger.
 Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundre...
                            Yeah, they're Italian.
                                 Moe? What the?...
                              It's about time. Oh.
            Well, that's a pretty big "if," honey.
       Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle.
                                               No!
 Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. ...
 Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you shoul...
 What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times ...
         Why not? Kids are very visual these days.
                                            But...
                                     Hey, shut up.
                                    Ow! Why you--!
                           Because I... Ow! You--!
                                               Ow!
                                               Ow!
                                               Ow!
                                 Why you little...
              We're free! Your mother set us free!
                                          Woo hoo!
                    Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha.
       But, Constance, it only happened because...
 Wait. I'm to blame, Judge. You see, I was pres...
                                       I admit it.
      Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately.
                                            Sorry.
                                           Dammit!
                     Well, that explains the sign.
 You know, we could get out of these stupid thi...
 You're right. It's time to stand up to that fi...

                  Shhh, you'll wake up Flanders...
                            Hey, Marge, surf's up!
             Well, we tried all those other tools.
                                          Woo hoo!
     Now, time for "Operation: Judge-Get-Back-At."
 Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's...
 It's only the milkman. Hey, maybe I should be ...
                       This address must be wrong.
    She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool.
                  I know, I know. Fight the power.
                                             Cops!
         Look at her in there, washing her body...
 I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there'...
                    Oh, it's just a friendly seal.
                                     Shut-uuuup...
               Oh Lord, guide this cinder block...
                                            Uh-oh.
                                Hey, how ya doin'?
                        So... it cost you nothin'.
                                   That was close.
                             Just the radio, dear.
 The bridge column. Oh, that South. You never k...
                       Probably digging for drugs.
                                No. Of course not.
 Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up...
 Oh hello, young man. Beautiful day for digging...
     Yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?
 So, I guess you wouldn't mind if I was to dig ...
                                     Maybe I will.
                                      Very little.
                           I'm having chest pains!
                        Where's the defibrillator?
                                            Clear!
                       This thing pays for itself.
   Yes. Eventually, I became King of the Morlocks.
                      You callin' me a liar, Carl?
                     Oh, I just naturally assumed.
                                          Woo hoo!
        Geez Moe, you've been a real crank lately.
 Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. Yo...
 Maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a wh...
                        That was an amazing throw.
             Hey, where'd that painting come from?
                                Ooh, ooh, pick me!
        Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.
 No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy be...
                 I thought you said you had to go.
       Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?
  Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?
            But on the other hand, Moe's not here.
 For what? A little splattered food never hurt ...
 Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like...
                                             Ayyy!
                      Oh! Whoa! Hemorrhage-amundo!
                                             Ayyy.
                                            Yello?
     Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?
                                   I don't get it.
                                   What's the gag?

                         Not for friends of Moe's.
                          Don't you know who I am?
                           Cecil is a girl's name.
                       Um... the rabbits are cute.
                Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.
                Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.
                                  Okay, look cool.
                                        That's it!
 I'm gonna tell Moe exactly what I think of his...
                        Moe, we want our bar back.
 Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turn...
                 I'll throw myself out, thank you.
                            I believe I had a hat.
                                          Suckers!

                                   Yes, Mr. Burns.
                                        Oh, sorry.
                                       No problem.
                  But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted.
   Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.
            You're going to ask her to marry you?!
           Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
                  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
                     Let go of her or I'll scream!
                      Well, this is my house. Ah--
             Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape.
                                     Pistol whip?!

 It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. ...
     How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?
                                          No, huh?
            Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings.

                                         Bye, Moe.
 Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away.
                                            Never!
               This is it. This is the old quarry.
                Someone's yellow belly is showing.
 And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see...
                  And someone has eaten the flesh.
         Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?

 Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good...

 Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking ...
                         I don't know how to feel.
                                           Got it.
                                     How was that?
 So, you think you know better than this family...
    Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy.
      Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.
             I think this tree could use an angel.

 Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we...
                         Okay, but talk like this.
                                             What?
   Look, Gabriel. We're learning to work together.
 Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger...
          No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz.

                                        I knew it!
  Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.
            Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!
                              Give it to me, baby.
                         It's okay. We're married.

 All right. I'll make a base camp here and try ...

                                    Wait a minute.
             Ha! Ha! We did it! Springfield rules!
                  Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!
 Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I...

                                   Get in the car.
 Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group...

                             Part of me knew that.
            I'm with you all the way. But first...
                 Cool. Should I take off my shoes?

                                       Broken jaw?
                                            Uh-oh.
                                           Mm hmm.

 That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket....
             Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge!
       Unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
                                  What's goin' on?
 Hey Marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any ...
                              Spill it, moneybags.
 It's like being married to my best friend, and...
 Hm, a million dollars? Wait a minute. How much...
           Hey Marge, I just thought of something.
 If we had Artie's money, I could get that snor...

                     Honey, did you get any sleep?
                                 Oh, I'm so sorry.
                                           Uh huh.
 Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no...
 And by funny stuff I mean handholding, goo goo...
 This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday co...

 Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for...
 Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back ...
                            That's enough running.
 Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once...

                       Just for twenty-five years.
 Oh no. If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be b...
 Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing ...
 My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to...
  Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.
 I saw something terrible, and I can't even say...
 I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see ...
                      Patty and Selma? Screw that!
                Just run the camera, you little...
                              Goodbye, my darling.
 Oh, it's no good. Everything reminds me of Marge.

                                            Sorry.
 Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flander...
 Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, ...
                                In South Carolina.

      All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!
       Doesn't matter. They have free health care.
                                         I'm rich!
             Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?
                                There she is, boy.
 Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So ...
 Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you. I'm gon...
                Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie.
                                        Oh, right.
                    Really? Ooh, this I gotta see.
                Oh, he just wants to make friends.
 Ooh, who's a good dog? What a goody doggie! Oh...
                               He's a good doggie!

      Well, you brought me into this world, so no.
                                      Dad, get up.

                        You're slow to react, Dad.
                        In real life he would die.

  Mmm! That's the next best thing to eating Lenny.
                                 I'm still hungry.
                           Those were my friends?!
   That's it, I'm going home. Which way to Ithaca?

     I told you, I have too much time on my hands.

                                      Stop it now.

     That giggle is none of my business. Or is it?
                                  What's a eunuch?
                                "Unique, unite..."
 Nothing, nothing. There's nothing eating me up...

 You might hear from your friends or co-workers...
                                     You bet I am!
                                   U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
               And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.
                     Yeah! 'Cause if they don't...

                                       Whee! Whee!

     That is called parenting. I'm going to Moe's.
                                 Good night, Bart.
                                 Good night, Lisa.
                               Good night, Maggie.
                     Cherish these moments, Homer.
 What the-- You earned how many credits without...
                                Against my wishes!
 Oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. But ...
                                     Oh, come on--
                                     You're right.
 I was trying to throw Bart over the roof, and ...
                     Marge, where's my pellet gun?
                                            Right.
                        Oh no, not the good cheek!
                                               Oh.

                         Happy anniversary, Marge!
                      What the hell is that noise?
 Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is...
                            Fine, I won't kill it.
                                   Finish the job.
      Are you sure God doesn't want it to be dead?
          If he wants to sleep with us, forget it.
 Once upon a time there were three bears. The end.
           Oh fine, I'll go back to the beginning.
 Oh no, I crushed that horrible bug. What shoul...
                                Uh, he's sleeping.
          Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh...
     Woo hoo! He's alive. Now you can't punish me.
 Lousy Community Service. Meals on wheels! Eat ...
                Uh, they discontinued the cobbler.
      Now let's not get into who smells like what.
                                   Safe and sound.
                                    That's better.

 Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. ...
                                         Laxative?
           The Missus prefers you call me Simpson.
                                Are you all right?
       Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--
                                            O-kay.

                    You'd be dead a million times.
          Oh man, what a day. I'd kill for a beer.
                   I'd stab somebody for a pickle.
                               Gimme some peanuts.
  I'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
                 What? It goes right by our house.
                       Here's my underwear drawer.

                             Now you do it for me.
                                   Goodbye, Marge.
                                            What?!
                                        I knew it!
 This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never be...
 Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I thi...
                              I've made my choice.
                              So hot, so sticky...
                                           Marge?!

                                     Wrong answer.
            Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?
 That's it. Nobody messes with my little girl. ...
 See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I...
 Interesting. All right, I've come up with a co...

                                            A cap!
                          From "The Woolly Bully."
                                 Do you sell hats?
                                        To people?
                                People with heads?
             Did you steal dolls from my daughter?
     Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie.
                   Good, 'cause I need directions.
                                             Aw...
 Hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. And ...

                                Speed it up, ugly.
                            Eh, he had a good run.
                    I'm gonna need help with this.
                                             Hm...
                      No, you've got chores to do.
 Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed...
 Wow, four of me. I think this could be a magic...
                   I'll take it from here, Fake-o.
                                           Uh-huh!
                       Man, are we evenly matched.
                                     I mean, four!
                       Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
     Yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card.
                                            Ned...
 Twenty-three. Now, today I'm gonna mow the law...

 Now to make sure this hammock never troubles a...
                           You'd think so, but no.
                          Yeah, it's a good group.
                                            Noooo!

                        What? By saying "Macbeth"?
                                      Saying what?

  Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me.
                              Hey, where's my car?
                   Will you make my sundae for me?
                 I'm hungry. Are they married yet?

                  Oh, it just needs a little love.
             Why do the things I love always burn?

      A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say?
                        I'm confused! Which is it?
 Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike ...
                 That's right. No questions asked.
                  There, there. You're both right.
 Son, would you like to ride your new bike out ...
                                    For true, son.
          Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
                          I'll assemble it myself.
                    I can make a bike. I made you.
 Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets so...
                     Oh man, this is so confusing.
                            What the Hell is this?
                                Bike's over there.

 I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, ...

                              You really think so?

                                  We're alone now.

                           Remember our honeymoon?
                               Marge, let's do it.

 And now, my darling, it's finally time for rom...

                                         This way!
                     Quick -- we can hide in here!
 Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now...
       This must be what it's like to be in space.
                   And yet, I've never been to me.
                    That sliding should stop soon.
                   This rolling is just temporary.
 Ah, that's better. So why do they call this pl...
 Marge, I guess we'll just have to make love in...
         Oh, you're on my hair. Oh, that's better.
                  No one does that to my daughter!

                                      Or should I?
                      I'll keep my promise, honey.

                           I already work for you.
                           Do I get two paychecks?

                         You know I'm not Pie Man.
                  Oh come on, she's a little girl.
                                            Sorry.
                                   The Dalai Lama!
 I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she...
                 Please forgive me, talking llama.
 No. I won't. There's only one way I can escape...
                 I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!
                       Yeah. Let's go home, honey.
                                  Was it the kiss?
 Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will...

                 Bart, you're grounded for a year.
                                Okay, three bucks.
       Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!

                       What are you talking about?
                          What time's the show on?
                           And what's the network?
                                     At what time?
                And if I wanna watch it, what day?

 Now if I wanted to see it on a certain day, wh...
    And what time? Would be a good time to see it?
       So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock...
                  So it's Mondays at nine, on NBC.
                                              CBS.
                                     On the radio.

        Oh, just great. Things couldn't be better.

            You lost that first game to hustle me!
                                            Marge?
                                These are for you.
 Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was...
                                I love you, Marge.
                                          Wha...?!
                            You're needed at home!
                            You're needed at home!
                     Well, that's very reasonable.
                 You stole my wife! I'll kill you!
                 Wow. I can see why she loves you.
                              You know everything.
                                   And what a man!
 Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. I...

                    Marge, what's happening to me?
    I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.
                                     I'm so itchy!
                                          Oh yeah.

 Marge, I realized something when I was trapped...
        Hey, that's great. Let's look at it after.
        You always find an excuse not to make out.
                         Ooh, a space marshmallow!

    If I can keep down Arby's I can keep down you!
 Must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then ...
                                     Still hungry.

                  Well, back to the drawing board.
      What happened to "for better or for worse?!"
 It's amazing. He tastes just like Jeffrey Tambor.

    That's an odd way to start handing out medals.

 And I know something much more fun I can do on...
           Singing opera made me good at painting.
                        YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME WANNA
                             THROW MY HANDS UP AND
                              KICK MY HEELS UP AND
                                  HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
                          A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!
                                  HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
                                       No problem.
                                 My, you've grown.
                                    Spilled milk?!
                               All over the floor.
          Hey Apu, what happened to all your milk?
                                     Does it work?
                            Hey Moe, got any milk?
                             It's paint. Or is it?
                                 Yeah, it's paint.
                   I've gotta find milk somewhere!

  Shut up! When you call in sick, who do you call?

                             I think it goes here.
                  Some of those were pretty funny.

                     Really? What's your handicap?
                                 I'm doing my job!

                        Maggie! You did all this?!
     And to pay you back, I'm returning your nose.
 Here's your nose. Daddy's putting back your nose.
                     Oh, wait. That's Lisa's nose.
                                    Thanks to her!

                        How could you not tell me?

 I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.

                      Yeah, you'd treat her right.
          Oh, right -- like "Dateline" did to you!
     We live in a house that is trying to kill us.
     Who is this "Dad" you speak of, Lisa Simpson?
                                              Yes.

               He's nailing something to our door.
                                 Ew, that's gross.

                       No, I'm gonna see it first!
                                     My space toy!

 Good, but not great. I'll go get some rat poison.

                   Not in front of the poison man!

                      Great time to nap, Einstein!
 Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved...
                        Were you listening at all?
 Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe....
                             I see you! I see you!

              Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
 No, Marge. You're the most giving person I kno...
    You told me something, but I wasn't listening!
                Fair enough! Kids, let's practice.
                                  Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
 That was good, but Lisa, you're still complain...
                             Maybe it's beef stew!
                                         Hot tubs!
                             Guys, what's it like?
              I want to buy your fanciest hot tub!

                                  Too much cherry!
              Ooh, lemon. That'll stop the cherry.

 Aw c'mon, Marge. There's nothing funnier than ...
                                        Not funny.
 None for me, Marge. I get free donuts at work!...
 ...groaning with a "United Nations" of donuts:...
             No pink box?! Wha -- what's going on?
                        You... can't... do that...

           You can't win us back with mere donuts.
  That is the most amazing donut I've ever tasted.
                            AND YOU LIKE POTATO...

                                          Oh yeah.
                        Marge? What are you doing?
 Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help...
 Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, yo...
     I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
                                       Catch, boy!
 Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why ...

                           You go rent us a truck.
 And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to...
        Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.

 Do you think you could use someone like me in ...
          I said someone like me, I didn't say me.
      Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!
                          Race you to the cockpit!
              Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.
 With that attitude, you'll never super in one ...
 Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing to...
        Blackmail your father in space, will you?!
                       Up -- that's my chair, boy.
 Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take...
                        I agreed to no such thing!
                              Where and what time?
                                            Never!
                                   What do I wear?
            Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.
 Boy, this has gone too far -- I quit! As soon ...

                                       It's stuck!
                         Can I help you with that?
 I'll do it myself. When we do things together,...
              Ooo, you're hot when you're horny...
              Ooo, you're mad when you're angry...
    Marge, you're really good with your left hand.

              Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.
 That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
                                 I could kiss you.
  Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.

             Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!
          You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!
                                        Aw dammit!

 Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that ...

 Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I...
                             What are we watching?
     After the title page it's Bob Dole's memoirs.
 Now that I have all this free time, I thought ...
 I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything ...
 And I also mixed all the spices together into ...
          Uh-oh. What kind of ventilating is that?
 Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me t...
 Watchin' hockey! Watchin' 'em pass that puck! ...

                        Marge! You ruined my shot!
 That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods ...
 It's four AM -- you kids should've been in bed...
                                 Oooh, the Nobies!

                            I would kill for that.

                Now to take care of the witnesses.

         Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!
                     Don't ask questions! Just go!

                            No, no, I oversold it.
              I'd give anything to bring you back.
                                         Fat Tony?

                            Are you gonna open it?

                          I don't like those guys.
             Oh no. I left a candy bar in my desk.
                                 Time to punch in.

               Way to get us back on topic, Marge.
                               You live like this?
 Dear Lord, if thy tornado must take me, please...

                   Were you worried about me, boy?
                       Clearly the boy's in shock.

     Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?
 Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?
   Uh, I'm here to check in for the three o'clock.
                               That's "Fake Name."
                            That's "Alias." Du-uh.

 Okay, Marge. But first, well, I have something...

                                    Who bought it?

        Fine. But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.
 Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in ...

                                       No I'm not.
                                      Yes you are.
                                      Yes you are.
                                 Yeah you are too.
 I know you are but what am I, infinity plus on...

 Hey! Ow! Ow! I thought you were my best friend...

                                    Today was fun.
                                  Why you little--

 Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I...

 ...your Ma says I should do something with you...
                       Wanna see me make a muscle?
   Well, that's everything I know that girls like.

 You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you...

                               Why you little...?!
                             It's good to be back.
                 Can we cuddle for a little while?
                                            It is!

 Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. In...

                   Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.
                           And you gave it to him?
                                    Eight million?

 But the thing you have to remember is that you...
           ...uh, because you want them to grow...
         ...and because you can't strangle a girl.
 Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks ...

                                  Hello, Flanders.
                                  Well, let's see.
                                They're all yours.
                                       Gimme that!
                                               So?
                                      Thanks, Moe.
                What's with the crazy getup, Barn?
                               Wow. Can I do that?
 What do you mean? All the time? Even when they...
                               Oh, I certainly do.
                         Huh, when do we get paid?
                                 Dasher, Dancer...

              And what would you like, little boy?
                      Why you little eggheaded...!
                         Oh, I knew that one, too.
 Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for th...
                               You both look well.
                      Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.
                                  And why is that?
        Well, I was just on my way out to get one.
                                               No!
                                            Uh-oh.
     So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isn't it?
                               That's an ornament.

                   I can't believe I'm doing this.
              Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind?

      I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.
                          Ah, forget it. Let's go.
                            Find any winners, son?
 Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh...

                           P.U. When is this over?
              Is that one fat enough for you, son?
                            Let's go get a burger.
 Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to ...
           Well, I guess we don't have to do that.
        Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.

          Ah, come on. We're going back to nature.
           What do you think? Should we stop here?
                                       All righty.

 Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart ...

                         Bart, what are you doing?
                                 Why you little...
                                            Ahhhh!
                                     Boy must die.
 Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but...
 I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don...
 Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I hear...
 Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I...
                                 What do you mean?
                 No, I can't. I'm just a big fool.
                                  How do you know?
                                             Karl.
 A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did ...
 Yet we at this power plant are doing this ever...

                                          Uh, why?
                I don't know... a hundred and two?
         What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.
                              Oh, better hurry up.
            I've never been more awake in my life.
 Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end jo...
                And... and?! What about loving me?

    Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
 Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.
 There you are, my man. And a dollar for yourself.
                       Huh? Well... it's all ours!
                          Motivated seller, Marge.
 So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.
                 Probably just the house settling.
                                     I don't know.
                                    Ooh, a vortex.

 Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about ...
                     It's got great high ceilings.
         Tell you what -- let's sleep on it. Okay?
                                What could happen?
       They are all against me! They all must die!
                                 Marge! Oh, Marge!
   Aw, come on, Marge. You said you'd sleep on it.

                                   Aw, gee, Marge.
 Not to worry. I'll just turn on the trusty bug...
             Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww!
                                              Wow!
         Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh, heh.
 That should just about do it. Man alive, there...
    The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly.
                   Hey! Get a load of that spread.

                                    Oooh, a feast.
                    Tell us more about this feast.
                               Marge, she's right.
 Listen, you big stupid space creature. Nobody,...
      Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.
                                Yeah, thanks Lisa.
                                              Huh?

 You are my brother. I love you and yet I feel ...

 That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himsel...

 Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on...
                   Your putter's name is Charlene!

                    I'm game if you are, Flanders.
 Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate yo...

                               That was beautiful.
      Goodbye, Maggie -- stay as sweet as you are.
     Goodbye, Lisa -- I know you'll make me proud.

                                             What?

         Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.
                                             Bart!
 Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. I...

                                         Good boy.

   Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.
  ...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
       Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down.
 It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge...

 Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that ...
                                         Oh great.
               Just a select circle of my friends.

                                     Come on, boy.
 Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me...
                 Yeah, at the worst possible time.
          The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
                           Cable clippers, please.

 Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk ...
                       Remember? Who could forget?
                But that was just an idle promise.
          Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't ...
                                      But Marge...
                                        All right.
                                             Okay.
 Hey! Why should she have a better husband than...
      Must find man. Must find man. Must find man.
           Boy, a good man really is hard to find.
                         One seafood burrito, Apu.
                                            Sorry.
                             What is it this time?
 But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skin...
 But if you weren't married to your job, you'd ...
 Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if...

 Ah, Moe. I've gotta find a date for my big, fa...
                       Like my wife's ugly sister.
       Hey, Selma's no prize pig herself you know.
 But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and...
            Oh, there's the little prom queen now.
                  Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!
                       Take it to the hoop, Selma.
 ... And thank you most of all for nuclear powe...
 Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart...
                                     Not one word.
                    I thought I said knock it off!
                   Well, no panta-ma-mime, either.

                  Twen... forty-eight. This is it.
                  Excuse me, is this an orphanage?
 Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed ...

                           What does it look like?
           Marge, this can't be the right address.
                                   Hello in there.
                                             Herb?
                    Holy moly! The bastard's rich!
 Herb, allow me to introduce my family. This is...
 ... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Mag...
            Yeah, though the boy was a close call.
              What's to know? Just dive in. Catch!
                        I feel the same about you.
                                  Even pork chops?
 You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the ...
 Wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got ...
                            Will you kids shut up?
                             Okay, we're watching.
 Hello, Cook? Sorry to bother you so late, but ...
           Are you sure you want to give me a car?
               Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then.
                                          Why not?
          Well, then give me one with lots of pep.
                                          America.
                                           You do.
                           And I want to let you!!
                                      Hi'ya, team.
                                          I dunno.
                                      What's that?
           All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?
                                  Oh yeah, he did!
                                         Oh, okay.
                                      Ugh, oh boy.
 Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board somethin...
                                              Huh?
                          Uh, yeah, I think I did.
                     Uh, may I be excused, please?
                   Because you think I'm a genius?
                    Because you think I'm dynamic?
                You think I work well with others?
                                        Oh, great.
  Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars.
                                          Sort of.
                                             What?

                                  What is it, boy?
 Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say ...

                          But I can't afford to...
   Okay, Flanders, you're the boss. Heh, heh, heh.
 Here's your magazines. How many of these guys ...

                               The price is right.

            Well, let 'em sleep on their own time!
                           Bart, get out and push.
             I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad.
                    Oh no! Dad's lost his hearing.
                                           Yell-o.

                                              Huh?

 Dad! Please, you gotta quit while you're ahead...
           But you could lose everything. Come on.
                    You'll be a bonehead. Come on.
                              Dad, no! Gimme that.

                               Hello, what's this?
      It's for you, Marge. From merry old England.
     Come on, Marge. Paint. I think you can do it.

 But you can tell, right? She looks around and ...
       Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A.
 Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me...
               You are smooth. I'll give you that. Never thrown a party? What about that big bash...

                     This isn't going well at all.
       No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.
 Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost s...

    Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.
                       Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah.
                                    How do I look?
                   Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
             What are all our friends names again?
                           Why not? I paid for it.

                    That thing you know how to do.
                                        Go to bed.

        Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
                               Why? What'd you do?
                                            Marge!
                         Where-where are we going?
                                  The way I acted?
 So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes...
                                   I put it there.
            I slipped it into your glass as a gag.

                        Whoa, better get some gas.
 Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.

           Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
 Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her ...
                                    She's perfect.
             Well, sometimes that can be annoying.
                                         I'm done.
                         It's true. It's all true.
                                            Sorry.

                                    Good! Give up!
                                              Huh?
 Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm ...

     Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
                    No, that thing with your feet.
                      Because I wore a pink shirt.

                                  I'm almost done.
                   I'll be there. Not-y not-y not.

                                  That was a joke?

                                     No, it isn't.
                                   Hmm, let's see.
                                              Nah.
                                             Hmmm.

                            Wouldn't it, Flanders?
 Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It...
 See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you...
                  Well, if it isn't the Leftorium.
                                   Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
                     Hey Flanders, how's business?
             So, Flanders, have you sold anything?
 I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serte...

                          Hey, boy. How was class?
                            Oh, that'll learn 'im.
           Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?
 Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a...

 Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey,...

                           Can I leave, Mr. Burns?
                 But the note was asking you to --
                                  Um, Mr. Burns...
                                  Sorry, Flanders.
                                              Huh?
                Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?
 Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, bu...

 Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's jus...
 I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpso...
                Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?
                      Uh, there's a store where...
                                             Yeah.

                                           I know!
                                          Why not?
                                               Oh.
                            Oh, it's all my fault.
                                        Yes it is.
                                No, I was a swine.
   Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?
           Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!
                                     I SAID DO IT!

                      Pfft. I make more than that.
               ... Bart! Have you started smoking?
                              Don't lie to me boy.
               Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought.

                               You think it's him?
    What are you talking about? Of course he does.
                      We could have seen a monkey.
                          He's talking funny talk.
             A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.

 Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf...
                            Yeah, Krusty, tell us.
    Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
                                 Why you little...
            No, that's it. You've seen everything.

                             I'd like to see that.
 What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in ...
                       Eeuhgh. What is this thing?
                                Oh yeah? How much?
 C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story....
     Why at that little shop, right over... there.
                   Oh no, wait, it was over there.
      Don't shoot, Don't shoot. They're souvenirs.

 C'mon, everybody. We're going to the fanciest ...
 Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this...

                   How do you know I was sleeping?
                                           Camera?
                               How hard can it be?
                            Ooo, what job is that?
                      Sheesh. What a slave driver.
                                  No. Bart bit me.
           I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
 I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just ...
                                   Umm. Spaghetti.
                      Oh, I hate having two heads.
                                           Y'ello.
                 Don't worry, I know it's tonight.
 Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother...
 Wow! And after them, out of all the people in ...
           Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?
 Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes ...
            Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?
 You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be...
       Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.
                 The moron next door closed early!

 Hmm. "Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxopho...
            Please, you've got to open that store.
 Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of...
              I'll have you know, I wrote it down.
             Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
            Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!
                                          I dunno.
                                               No.
                                               No.
 No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one a...
           Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father.
                                            Uh-oh.
                             Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!
      I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
                   That cost eighty-eight dollars!
 Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know t...
                             You didn't mean that!
 No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed t...

                               Ha ha, you love me.
                                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
                                               Mm.
                                              Buh.
                                             Sneh.
                    Excuse me, do you sell ponies?
       "Scot-tish deer-hound." Hey, this is a dog!
 Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little g...
                          Half a million dollars?!
                                              Wow!
                                     I'll take it!
             Uh, sure... let me write you a check.
                     Is there a problem with that?
 Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up...
       I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
                Mr. Burns, you do this personally?
                                          U-su-ry?
                             I want to buy a pony.
 No. I need to get it for my little girl becaus...
                                            Sorry.
                                        Of course.
                    Simpson, you've done it again.
 Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of he...
                    Because she stopped loving me.
 I know you love me. So you don't get squat. He...
 I've got it all figured out. By day it will ro...
 That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she lo...
                    Stable? That sounds expensive.
                  This is what love costs a month?
                                          Oh nuts.
                       I was hoping it'd be money.
 Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vacc...
               Nah, we're not gonna be doing that.
 First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now,...
             Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays.
 Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out ther...
   Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
                           Need money. Need money.
                     One Scratch-for-Cash, please.
 Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, ...
                                        Thank you.
                                      There it is.
                                               No.
                                           No! No!
                     No! You can't see... come on!
                                               No!
                        Let go. You're ripping it.
                              Ohh... I need money.
                          You're looking for help?
                                     I'm your man!
                                          Woo-hoo!
                                ...Badge of honor.
                                  But I eat... Oh.

                                          Yes sir.
            I don't know. How long do horses live?
                 Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
                                           Y'ello.
         Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?
                     Going for... eight hour walk.
                                  Homer sleep now.
                             Coming right up, sir.
                                         Yes, sir.
 Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing ...
                                          You did?
                Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!
                                             Awww.
       Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!
                      That baby changed our lives.
               Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
                                    In the garage.
                    Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.
      If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
                            Okay, okay, calm down.
                             Okay, I will. I will.

                   I don't know. Some guy I guess.
                                         How much?
 What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to ...
                      Anything for my little girl.
 Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame....
                                  Ooooooh, McBain.
                    Why? I just saw the best part.
  Just grab something. All these movies are great.
          Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman.
                                         Oh Marge.
 Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's...
                                       Okay. Hank.

                                    Steve McQueen.
                                             Next.
     Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.
                           Then he has no hobbies.
                                  Bart!... BART!!!
           You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?
 Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are...

 Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... ...

 Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm...
 Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy ...
                                              Huh?
                               Oh, how I envy you!
     I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
                                         What boy?
       Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.
     Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
                        Okay. No, I'm gonna do it.
 But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot...

 Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry ...
      Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!
                                               No!

                                            Sorry.
                       No. Can't think of a thing.

                                  He's not so fat.
                       Bart, why are you still up?
 Boy, they've got better things to talk about t...
                                  What is it, boy?
 Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, yo...

 You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to pu...
                                   Run for it boy!
                        That's it. I'm outta here.
                           What's the matter, Moe?
                  Yeah, things are tough all over.
                               Could I get a beer?
 Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot...
 One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing...
 As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick,...
   Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?
 I decided to mix the little bits that were lef...
 In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids...
      It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
 I don't know the scientific explanation, but f...
                                A "Flaming Homer".
                 Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?
                          Try lighting it on fire.
                   Well, it's called a "Flaming...
 Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded sin...
                                      Why yes I --
 I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is...
                        Take that off this second!
                            I need to talk to Moe.
                   I didn't even tell you my name.
                                    Homer Simpson.
                                             But--
                                           Barney?
                          You're my kid's teacher!
                                               No!
                                 Get away from me.
                                         Hey, Moe?
                I'd rather have a "Flaming Homer".
 How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was...
 If there was any justice, my face would be on ...
 Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. ...
        I said, you just lost yourself a customer!
                You just lost yourself a customer.
           You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!
                You just lost yourself a customer.
                You just lost yourself a customer.
                         Ah, my new watering hole.
                                           A beer?
                         Can I have a clean glass?
 Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing...
 Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm...
            Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.
                              Moe... Moe... Moe...
                                Moe... Moe... Moe.
              Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe...
 Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures...
 Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over...
          Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?
 Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of...
                                       I guess so.
 Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a...
   Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?
                            Oh, what do they want!
                                    It's not fair!
                                           Uh-huh.
                       Ooh, that's a lot of money.

                                      I own stock?
                     So uh, how much did it go up?
                                           Yeah...
                                           Sure...
                                   Not any more...
                                  That'd be great.
                              Well... how are you?
                 Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?
                                 What should I do?
   Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
           Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer...
 No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Priva...

   Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?
 Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it f...
                                       Hey... hey!
                                        You heard?
     Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too.
                               I spent it on beer.
 Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talkin...
        What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
                                               Ow!
       Did you buy this car with your stock money?
                       We could all lose our jobs.
                         Well, they can't fire me.
                                       Cuz... I...
                                     Lucky drunks.
                      Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!
 Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know...
                         Good, good, I'm learning.
                       Because we send them money?
                                    Oh, woa is me.
         Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it.

 Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so ...
                                               No.

               I think I did pretty good in there.
 Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say...
                                 No problems here.
       I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!
 That's right. I lost my job so that you could ...
 Let me ask you something. Does your money chee...
 Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, doe...
               And does it ever say, "I love you?"
 Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old...
                               Nobody loves you...
                       Na na na na / Na na na na /
                       Woo-hoo! I got my job back!
 But Marge, this one came with a free corncob p...
           Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?
    Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?
 Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my ches...
 No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, b...
                                            Maybe.
 Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games...
                Yeah, but I have to hear about it.
 Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your moth...
 Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of...
 For several years I'd been dating your mother ...
                                         Yes, sir.

 Your mother was living with her two wicked sis...
           You mean like will apes be our masters?
                    But it gives me time to think.
    Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!
 Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth ...

               Someday I'll buy you a real castle.
                                       Phew, good.
          Really? It must be the Champale talking.
          Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
                            Pass the cookie dough.
                         Y'ello... Oh, hi Marge...
                                Why? What's wrong?
                                               Oh.
                                           ... ...
           Because it's the honorable thing to do?
 Marge, there's something I want to ask you. Bu...
           Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?
 Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a car...
                                    What's it say?
                    That's the card. Give it here.
                          So... will you marry me?
 Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. ...
 You know, I had this very same discussion with...
 Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call ...
                    They'll call him Screwy Louie.
                                             Slob.

 Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, ...
                                     I don't know.
 Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much...
         Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.

            Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York.
 Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon...

           Look, I know it wasn't our best season.
             Well, this year's gonna be different.
                           I have a secret weapon.

                             Bart! Close the gate.
 Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait!...
                                Uh...the last one.
 That was his dish, and that was his leash, and...
                Oh, Marge! There is no such place!
          Or... to put it another way... there is.
               And I'll be right here watching TV.
                                Two tickets for...
                             Let me pet him again!
                  I know. I want to pet him again!
                        The cat? What's the point?
                         Oooh, there's a good one.
          Marge, that's just a suggested car size.
       Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?
 Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, ...
                         Ooh, they all look great.
         Look Who's Oinking! "Look Who's Oinking"!
                                     That's right.
               Why Marge, you frisky little devil.
 We'll take two tickets to "The Stockholm Affair."
                                        Political!

                                            Mmm...
                                      Ew, a skunk!
                                            Oh no.
                               Ooh, a redneck bar.
                                      Duff please.
                                    Okay, Fudd me.
                  Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
                                           Yeah...
                                  ... that's true.
                                           Uh-huh.
       That's right, except for the pick-up truck.
 Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, an...
 Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' ...
 Your song touched me in a way I've never felt ...
                                 Homer J. Simpson.
                             That's a pretty name.
                 Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
                                      Bye Lurleen.
                                           Y'ello.
      I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.

            Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town.
 Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. ...
            Do you think I could get a copy of it?
 Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and ...
                                     Come with me!
                                       I guess so.
           Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?

      My personal hygiene has been described as...
                                Marge, look at me.
         Uh, then maybe you better not look at me.
                        A friend bought it for me.
                       No... I think it was Lenny.
                                               No!
                                               No!
                                   A coupla times.
                         I can't. I'm her manager.
 Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhoo...
 Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and wh...
                    I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
 Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. ...
 Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one...
 I don't have time to answer all these question...
                                          Stop it.
                               You, off the bench.
       Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV.
 Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now o...

                                       Never mind.
 I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things...
 I gave Herb all the money I had in the world.....

                          Maggie! Cut that racket!
                  And where exactly are you going?
      Well, this is the first I've heard about it.
 Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me ...
                                 Kids, back me up.
                               Match point, Homer.
            That's okay. We're none of us perfect.
 Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any...

                           Did you raise the dead?
                              But the car is okay?
                                   All right then.

                              I can't afford that!
                            Dad, I have a problem.

 Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given ...
                                About three weeks.
     Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk.
                                       What? What?
                   All right, you win round seven.
                                   Your what-what?
 Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know!...
 Wait a minute. That was a "Lucy" show... Okay,...
         Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in...
 Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me...
                                     Hi, Flanders.
                            I could use a TV tray.
                                            Whaat?
                               You said, anything.

            Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius.
 I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed...
                                 Patience, my pet.
 Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be t...

     Where's the beef? No wonder he won Minnesota.
                                I like those odds.
         Please, please, please, please, please...
                              Can you say "Daddy"?
                        U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!...
                 Here, Bart, you can hold my beer.
                                             What?
                                 Goodnight, honey.
 Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah.
                             No, sweetie. "Daddy."
 Y'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the soon...
                      I hope you never say a word.
 I can't wait till they throw his hatless butt ...
                          My heart is just fine...
   Just workin' the turkey through. There it goes!
 You know that feeling you get when a thousand ...
                       It could only be one thing.

                                 Come on, come on!
 I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumpin...
        Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission.
                                              Huh?
                                             More.
                                        Thank you.

                       Does whiskey count as beer?
         Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor.
                          It's my life-long dream.
                                         Oh, yeah.
         Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true.
                                That's right, boy.

 Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket ...
              And I'm a college student! Heh, heh.
        But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now!
 I'm not pouting. I'm... mourning. Stupid dead ...
                     Ding-dong, the witch is dead.
                          Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.
              Hey you don't hear Lisa complaining.
   Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's good.
                                             What?
                      All right, I'm almost there.
                                           Please.
 Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie po...
                       It's just not fair, dammit!
                All in favor of skipping the poem?
                                        Thank you.
                                           Uh, oh.
                 Sure... unless another aunt dies.
 Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty despera...
                                      I knew that.

                         I'll give it a good home.
     Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge.
                                 Suggestion noted.
 Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich ...
                                              Yes.
          I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens.
                                       S-s-o cold.
                    No! Duff... Gardens... hurrah!

                   Hi, kids. How was Duff Gardens?
 You take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around...

                             What'd ya say, Marge?
    Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something.
                I can't think with all this noise!
                         What am I supposed to do?
                Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?

                                           Hit me.
                                           Hit me.
                        Hey, boy! Where you going?
                  Have a good time! Wait a minute.
                                     So that's it!
                  Hello, son. Where have you been?

                               He's got my hotdog!
          Oh... it's you. So, you're looking well.
             For your information, I'm his father!
               That's right. And who might you be?
          Look! There's another disadvantaged boy.
                                        Oh. Right.
          This is even more painful than it looks.
                                      Thanks, son.
                                             Yeah?
                                        Sure, boy.

              Step on his neck, and run like hell.
                         Happy... Valentine's Day!

                 Yes! You saved my life. How much?
     What? That's highway robbery! I won't pay it!
                                   Forget it, pal!
        All right. But I'll never shop here again.
                                             Sold!
                       I'd sell my first-born son.
                           You'll do as your told.

                                          Why not?
                                               No.

                        Thank you, that'd be nice.
                                        Do I ever!

 Now, you can stay with us until you lose that ...
                  Oh, wait. That was the old sofa.

         Well, you haven't heard the last of them.

                    We all went our separate ways.

                                    Do we have to?
                  Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
 Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus...

 Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war...
                Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head.
                                       Hiya, gang!
      Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor...

 We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours...
                             You take that back...
            Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
                         Oh, not Souter... Oh, no.
                       I'll write it on my hand...
 C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is ...

                You have to kill the head vampire.
                         What the hell's so funny?
                         Stupid TV. Be more funny.

          Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum.
                   Heh, heh, heh. It was worth it.

                            Yeah. What's the deal?
                And I can just haul it away? Free?

                                      There we go.
       That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
                           Yep, it's finally gone.
 If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break ...

                                   What up, Marge?
                 Marge, can I go outside and play?
            And that sends me into a shame spiral.
      Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.
                And I feel that you hear my shame.
                         I feel validated by that.
                                           Me too.

 Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about ...

                                               No!
                         Marge, you waited for me.
                            Okay, Marge, let's go.
                        Marge, I'm taking the car.
          This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
                                          Marge...
 Wait. I see what's happening here. You're just...
 You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Coll...
 Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let...
 Marge, we need to talk. You're spending too mu...
                          Woo hoo! Problem solved!
                        Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What's up?
 Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all ...
 Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll ge...
 Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may...
 Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident inv...
                              Aw. Just like on TV.
 Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that...
 It's always something isn't it? First, I have ...
                                Ow...ow...ow...ow.
                               Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
                             Oh yeah, the costume.
                                  Hello, Floreeda.
 No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gamblin...
 Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn ...
                                   Can't talk now.
                You broke a promise to your child.
 You promised Lisa to help her with her costume...
 Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling...
 No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it ...
                      Can't talk. Robbed. Go hell.
 You know, Marge, for the first time in our mar...
 Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing...
 Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambl...
                Well, you have a gambling problem!
                                   Aw, what a gyp.
                            And remember when I...
                        Oh yeah. I forgot already.
                                          Woo hoo!
                           Eh, that's no big loss.
 Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of...
                                 Shhh, quiet Lisa.
                           Curse you, Magic Beans.
 Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I w...
                      Let me check my reason list.
                                Yep. It's on here.
 Alright, these are our new family security rul...
                        Marge, they're only human.
 Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got...
 Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-...
 Aw, honey. I didn't realize how much that horn...
           You know Lisa, music helps daddy think.
      I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?
                                 I'm someone else!
 We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someo...
                       Sorry, Dad. You're too old.
 Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, bu...
            Marge, we're responsible adults and...
 ... and if a group of responsible adults can't...
 Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake...
              No, we're forming a vigilante group.
               Put this in your pipe and smoke it.
                         Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
         Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs!
                                            Sorry.
       Okay, men, it's time to clean up this town.
 You know, push people around, make ourselves f...
            Bart, give me that megaphone of yours.
 Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me...
                                 Move along there.
    Return to your homes and places of businesses!
          Hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?
                                          Get him!
               No burning leaves without a permit!
                                         Too late.
 You better have a good reason for doing that, ...
                       You're in. Here's the sack.

                                       He'll show.
                                     It's his job.
                                   He's a burglar.

                                I didn't say stop.
                        Aw, Dad, I could kiss you.
             No wait! I know where the burglar is!
 So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been...
    Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa.
 I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat bur...
                                          Shut up.
                                       No kidding.

              Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!
  He's a box! My boy's a box! Damn you! A boooxxx!
  Marge, I have some horrible, bone chilling news.
                                      Oh, nothing.

                                     There, there.
 Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that...
               Come on, Lisa. Say something funny.
 Oh, something stupid like Bart would say. Buck...
 Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing...
          What the hell are you readin' books for?
             Don't forget to say "I didn't do it".
                            How do you figure boy?
 All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out ...
                       That dog can sell anything.
                 What kind of catchphrase is that?

                            Oooh, this one's open!
 Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... No...
                       Your old meat made me sick!
     This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
                                          Woo hoo!
 Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is ...

 You can't sell that. Karma can only be portion...
                            Is he still out there?
 What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa...
 Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chip...
 Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to...
                                       Outrageous.
              Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there.
                                 Pass the chutney.
 That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
 Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are ...
                           Ub. Apu friend me good.

                              Are we in India yet?
                       This isn't very convenient.
       Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?

                So, here's to my best friend, Ned.
                                       Food fight!

                 Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?
                              Right, no reporters.
                                           O-okay.
 Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine do...

                                  Oh dear God, no.
                              I call the basement.
                                         All done.

 What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we ...
               Use only in a well ventilated area.
                                  Shove it, buddy.
                                          Nothing.
                                             Okay.
                                           Y'ello.
                                           Y'ello?
    He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
          Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!
 We'll call you back! Bart! With ten thousand d...
                            Lisa, go to your room.
                                              Wee!
              Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore.
 Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory ...
                          What's he yelling about?

                                       Plants, eh?
             Hey, any more arboretums around here?
   That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!
                                 Grooming him, eh?
  I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.
                            Hey, what's with them?
 Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. "Chain for...
 Well these bills'll have to be paid out of you...
              Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
                           For the ninth time, no!

          Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
     What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?
                                 He likes peanuts.
 I only have two questions. How much, and give ...
                             So, your bid is zero.
                                        Thank you.
                                        Thank you.
 Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less like...
    Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant.
                                             Done.
                                  Here's the keys.
                        I'll just keep these then.
                                 He took Bart too?

 Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the...

                                 I'd like it fine.
 Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that...
                                              Huh?
 Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can strugg...
         Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...
 I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this...
 Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stamp...

                                     Mmm. Caramel.
         Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.
                           Woo hoo! What do I get?
                                          Woo hoo!
 Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, ...

 Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. J...

              Yeah, let's push him down the steps.
 How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spen...

 That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusi...
                                 Bart, you listen.
                                  My secret shame.
                         Bart, you're coming home.
 Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees?...
                He locked the door! I'll show him.
          You idiot! He was the most talented one!
                  Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?
             Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!
                               I'll miss you, son.
 Son, I know you're upset because you thought y...

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this ...
                            Well, I'm off to work.
 But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement.
 Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right,...
                     How many "s"'s in "innocent"?
                                     That is true.
         I can't let the boy see me skipping work.
                               How do you do, sir?

                                       Okay, fine.
                       What does sequestered mean?
                        What does deadlocked mean?
                                 Uh-huh. And "if"?

             I don't like this new director's cut.
                                     Got it, Barn?
 I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take...

              Maggie, can you point to the monkey?
                        Pfft. What do babies know?
           What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.
                                              Ooh.
                       Or, if not then, Christmas.
                Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny.
 Marge, please. Old people don't need companion...
                                               Oh.

                                   I was bluffing.

 Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to ...
 Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!
                    It's all right! I'm a teacher.
 All right, the first thing they told me to do ...
                       Down the hall, room twelve.
                      Ew. Okay, let's get started.
                                       No talking.
 Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how ...

 Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!
                        Bees are on the what, now?

 It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mo...
                                        Like what?
   Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
      Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!
   There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?
                                             Hmmm.

                                               Hi.
                                         Gotta go.
 I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
                                     I mean hello!
 That's okay. I'll just push the button for the...
                                    That's unsexy.
                                               Ew.
                           Well, this is my floor.
                              See you tomorrow....
 I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nu...
 Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm ...
       Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.
                                               Oh!
                                       Go to hell!
              I was doing my best to resist her...
 But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom.
                                       Yeah, yeah.
 Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have...
                 Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
                             But they're so sweet.
                                         Oh, baby.
  She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
 Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Loo...
             Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
       All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!
                                            Marge?
                                             Sure.
                                          Who? Oh.

               Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?
             The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge.

                Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.
                          It was, Marge. Admit it.
         Oh good, here comes the collection plate.
       We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed.
             Stop him! He's headed for the window!

                 Well, that's kind of a gray area.

                         Hey, that's a half truth.
                                             Whaa?
     Ooh, "Portrait!" Sounds classy... doesn't it?
               I don't have a friend in the world.
                        Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.
                                     I need a hug.
                      How come you guys hesitated?
             Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
                           Are you hugging the TV?

                                You're both right.

      Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.

         Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie.
                            Communication. Gotcha.
                              Listen. Yes, I know.
                          I have listening skills!
                                   Shut up, Judge!
              Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.

 Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out ...
                                  I'm not ashamed.
               How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?
           I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!
                 Forty seconds? But I want it now.
   Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?
                             Hi, is Milhouse home?
                                 Mmm. Sounds good.
             Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!
                             And he knows my name.
 Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe...
                                    Run, boy! Run!

                                               No.
                                  That's the plan.
 Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is...
                       It was good, but not great.
                    Come on, eat the can. Come on.
                              Out of the way, you.
                                              Aww.
                                     Hey Flanders!

                         Hello. Mr. Burns' office.
          It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.
                                    Yes! Yes, sir!
    I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir.
 No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to ...
                           Yello?... It's for you.
                                               No.

                                           Got it.
      I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns.
                                            Uh-oh.
            Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother.
 Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say ...
           You really blew it this time, Smithers.
                                             Okay.
                                    I'll show you.

                                        Aw, nertz.
                       Which one's Itchy? The car?
                  Oh. I guess that's not him then.
     Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.
             All right... Wait a minute. For what?
                                        Forget it.
                                     Okay. Grampa.
                                             Okay.

            Ummm... Do you have a crush on anyone?
                             I won't tell anybody.

                                   I'll take that.
      I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised.
                                            Hello.

               Eh, you have any sugar around here?
                                    Eh... I... no.

 All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All rig...
                    Then I can just push him over.
                                           No one.
                                            Never.
                                          Nothing.

 Ooh, "General!" Who's Drederick Tatum, anyway?...
 Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat ...
 Uh, well... I was gonna surprise you, but, um....

 And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.
                                   Oh, yes we are!
                                Oh, yes, there is!

  No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.
  Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something.
                              Do I have to sit up?
                               Knock yourself out.

                What the hell is wrong with you?!!
                                         For what?
                         I don't wanna go to that.
        That doesn't sound like something I'd say.

     Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.
                         Marge, will you marry me?
 No, it's a second wedding, Honey. Our first on...

                                         Hi, kids.
                              Where's your mother?
                                        Hi, honey.
 Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't ...
 Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to ...
                                             Okay.

    Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer.

                                            Marge?
        Really? You were? But how did you find me?
      Or that little guy on the "Don't Walk" sign.
 Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, ...
 Right, and we don't like the same things. It's...
  Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters.
 ...But our sames go right down to the bone. Ma...

        The light! We gotta get the light back on!
            They see us! They're starting to turn!
                         We sure did... soul mate.
                     TGIF! Guys, I'm off to Moe's.

                         No time for you, old man!
                            Please, don't hurt me!
                                          Yaaaa...

 I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another...
 Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered ...
                                               So?
 Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being m...
    Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's?
                               Lousy loveable dog.
 Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold metal ...
 The alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like U...
                   You don't have to humiliate me.
                                    No, I'm sorry.
                                              Yes.

                            Well then, good night!
       Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too.

 Now son, they do a lot of quality programming,...
                                        I kill me.
 Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's...
                               No! No! No-o-o-o-o!
                                     Yeah, me too.
                                         It's him!
 As a representative of planet earth, let me be...
                             Bwah! Bwah! Bwaaaaah!
     It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.
             Good work, son! We did it! We did it!
  Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape!
 Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have...
  Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.
                                          Uh, yes.
                           This interview is over!
 Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any "...
                             Marge! How could you?
                                    I'll take two!
                                Look! There it is!
                                    Thanks, Marge.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit ...
 What do you need to make money for anyway? As ...
 Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in t...
     No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!
                                          Oh yeah.
                           Uh, your fish are dead.
                                    Hey, pretzels!

                      That means thank you, Marge.

 Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the m...
 Aw, looks like Mr. Pretzel Man is doing pretty...
                       I'm here to see Mr. Ormand.
 Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of ...
 You're my last hope. I've never reached out to...
 I had a feeling things would work out for you,...
                                      Thanks, Moe.
                    Yeah, my wife is raking it in.
          Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?
 You mean the mob only did me a favor to get so...
                              In those words? Yes.
 How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart ...
                          So what are we gonna do?
                  Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa.
                                         Now what?
                     You heard her. She said "no."
 But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anythin...
 Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you ...
 You must hate me, Marge. Every time I try to h...
                       Hey, that's the fire alarm!
                         I think I won, Mr. Burns.
                                          Woo hoo!
                    Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!
 So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupi...
                                              Huh?
 Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I w...
                                Well, here we are.
       Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
                                Uh, I lost my map.
                        Hey, this sounds like fun.
                                             Oooh.
                                  Uh, not as such.
                            Yes, lotta hysteria...
                Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!
       Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns.
                                 No sir. I am not.
                            That worked sooo well.
               No going through the window for us!
 You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I ...
            Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs.
 Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit li...
 Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tin...
                                               Oh?
                         Use it wisely, my friend.
                                You got it, buddy.
                    Um, I don't see one. Unless...
                           No. There's no way out.
                             You can supervise me.
                                      We sure did!
 I think when we yelled we caused another avala...
           Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .
                        I think they've stopped. .
                                          So what?
             It could be days before they find us.
                           We could build snowmen.
                                       Oh... Okay.
   Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!
                                           Agreed.
              Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns.
                                    What do we do?
                                You and what army?
                                          Burnsie!
 Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who...
                                      Marge, kids.

                             Marge, get me a beer.
 Your mother seems really upset about something...
           Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers.
                                              Eww.
 Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball ...
 Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.

   I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.
                  You have my undivided attention.
                     MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.
          AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--

                                    Well, so am I.
 Okay. Question two -- who was your last employer?
                           Marge, do we know them?
 Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The b...
             Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?
                                Ooh, she is tough.
            I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.
                               Come to bed, Marge.
                              No, no. Leave it in.
                          NOT TILL YOU'RE FIFTEEN.
    Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding.
 Blood, uch! I'll just stick to the brain and k...

 You'll find it's even more fun if you get it f...
                              Oh, that poor woman.
                                             Nope.
                                      Indubitably!

                                SHUT UP, FLANDERS.
                          I'm sure we will, honey.
                                 I'm sure we will.
 Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open castin...
                                         I do not!
                I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
 Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' "Howdy" to a...
 Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't so...
           Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog.
 Oh, "no attitude," eh? Not "in-your-face," huh...
        Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.
 Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, ...
        Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you.
 She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wa...
                           You? But you're a lady.
 Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so ...
                             You mean "meep meep"?
 Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air ...
 I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question...
              What the hell are you talking about?
                  Quiet! You're missing the jokes!
                   Well? What did everybody think?
                       So it was pretty okay, huh?
              Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?
                       I'm the worst Poochie ever.
  Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!
 You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm no...
                            Put a sock in it, Roy.
                                      No I am not.
                                            Never!
 You can't just kill off a classic TV character...
 Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I kno...
 Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie....
 Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those fin...
 Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing i...
 Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip ...
             Aw, nuts. Hel-lo? China? Little help?
                                  That is so true.
                                    What happened?
         Give her a break! Her husband was killed!
 Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, bu...
      Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.
 No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graph...
                 Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies.
            And that kind of stuff is worth money?
 Man, you should come over to our place. It's f...
 I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock?...
                                    Do I know you?
                             Ow! Why you little...
 Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a ...
           So, do those records have "camp value?"
 That John is the greatest guy in the world. We...
 Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lot...
             Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
                                      Who doesn't?
                                          Right...
 OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced w...
 Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property value...
 Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but ...
 You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV...
                             No! No, no, no, no...
 No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this hous...
 How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened!...
                                  Oh, and I'm not.
                 Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?
                                       Uhh... huh.
      Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!
 There's only two kinds of guys who wear those ...
 Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is a...
                         You! I should have known!
 Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy...
                                               No.
 You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there ...
 No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! Th...
 Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent "you ...
                                 Homer storms out.
 Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight...
 Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places...
 Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll al...
 ... as a father! A father!! A regular father!!...
                  Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
        Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?
 That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. Wha...
 Okay, that didn't work. But I know something t...
 Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's...
 Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us...
            You'll thank me on your wedding night.
                  Has the whole world gone insane?
 I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all ...
 Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole ...
                 Oh, my God, what's happening now?
             ...and the entire steel mill was gay!
 But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You ...
                                      Hunting, eh?
 Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hu...
       Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?
             It just does! Name me one gay Indian!
 Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know abou...
 Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when ...
 No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You'...
      That is a very immature attitude, young man.
 Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed...
           Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian.
 No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been ...
  Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!
                     Yep, and it's your shot, son.
   C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?
 Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I tur...
        Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!
                                      Me too, son.
 Son, there comes a time in every father's life...
                                          UNNGHH!!
                 Just... my bones... and organs...
                                     What the -- ?
                     Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!
                                   It's a miracle!
                             I've been tenderized.
 Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you cal...
                                     Amen to that.
 Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion t...
                                  He said "tried"!
                           Oh, all those stairs...
 Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the on...
 And sure, he's probably so insane with rage th...
                      In a medium-security prison.
                       Unless he gets out somehow.
 Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many...
                 Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
                                         Lisa too?
 Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your di...
            Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!
 You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered...
       The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
 Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick ...
 Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, ...
                             I'll have to ask her.
    Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
 Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all t...
                       Can you see the pie stains?
 Take it like a man, boy. And do everything you...
 Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's pract...
 All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remem...
                                You've never been?
                Nah, I'm really more of a slacker.
 Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities...
          Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs.
 You know, honey, when I think of all the good ...
                          Did you see that, Marge?
           Don't laugh at me! I was once like you!
 What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved ...
 Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. Sh...
                          Give me the drugs, Lisa.
 It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm ...
 Oh, Moe, thank God you're here! We'd like to c...
    Look at me! I'm the Prime Minister of Ireland!
                               I'll come with you.
 Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother...
 Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and...
        Glad you're finally back in business, Moe.
 At first I thought prohibition was a good thin...
                                               No.
 Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. ...
                  Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do...
                      C'mon, boy, think of a plan.
                                      I've got it!
 We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back,...
 Right. Now remember, don't mention this to any...
                     Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope.
                                     Hang on, son!
                             Really? I heard good.
                                          Nothin'.
 Before! Before! You're living in the past, Mar...
          Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.
  Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!
                            Yeah, suck like a fox!
 You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging,...
 Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast...
 I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! O...
 Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill ...
                                              Huh?
 It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money ...
                                     No you won't.
                                            Won't.
 Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to...
                               Call me Beer Baron.
   But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!
 Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpe...
                                    "Make it," eh?
                       Forty-two bathtubs, please.
                                 I said forty-two!
 Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust la...
                    Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?
 Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have bee...
         Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear.
                                       What, dear?
                                        Ka-BLAMMO.
                                             Boom.
                               I'll be right back.
                                         It's hot!
 I thought about what you said, honey, and I've...
 Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wo...
 Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look t...
 Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a ...
                                      Poor Wiggum.
         I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?
                        The guy who took your job.
 Hey, how would you like to show him up by beat...
                     You forgot one thing, Wiggum.
                 I filled the balls with a funnel.
          Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist...
                             Last time I help you.
    Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore.
 To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all...
             Alright, men. Get ready to blast off!
 Wooo, we're in orbit now! What's that? A call ...
                                   Mayday! Mayday!
 Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is "Kraba...

                      When? When? Ich bin hungrig!
 Yes! My precious "CarTOONS!" "Who pumped Ethyl?!"
                               Marge, mail's here.
  Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!
 Hi Marge, hi Santa's Little Helper, hi kid -- ...
               Wow, I gotta start going to church.
 Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed eve...
 Geez, that dog has more education than I do. H...
 Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda......
                          Do you think he noticed?
                                              Who?
 No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist ...
                              Crowds give him gas.
                          Wow, TV's Kent Brockman.
          You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?
 I'd take him, but those cards are non-transfer...
                                           Can do.
 Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy ...
                                           Laddie?
        He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
 You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel ...
 There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you...
 Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, un...
           Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.
                      The bad dog or the good dog?
                                          Oh good.
                                            Marge!
          Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!
                                         Oh, okay.
                                Can Lenny have it?

                 No, the bank put Lenny in charge.
               Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good.

                           Lisa! You have a guest!

                                              Huh?

 I wish I had a nickel for every time I've hear...
              Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.

                   Okay. Do I have to do anything?
 Oh, I can't believe it. I've got an enemy. Me!...
                          No, I won't accept that.

                                          I guess.

  Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son.
                                   Or "crapweeds".
              Not if they were called "scumdrops".

              Okay, once more. Where are we going?
      And why are you and the old lady in the car?
                            And why is Marge here?

                          You call that prime rib?
 It's green, moron. Earth to stupid guy, hullo?...
                              Heh, still got it...
                  Geez, what's with all the death?

 Oh, I've lost everything. I can't go on. No, n...

                  Hey, what happened to the tunes?
 Hey, what the hell's goin' on? Where'd you get...
                                   You're mutants?
                    You want me? Come and get me!!
                                  A c... a coffin!
                       Die, you chalk-faced goons!
                               Go to hell, cloaky!
                                     Safe at last.
                   That better not be the mutants.
                        Marge! Kids! You're alive!
                                     Ohh, com'ere.
                   Now that's the Marge I married.
             So, who wants to steal some Ferraris?
 Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, every...
                                       He's crazy.
 Hmmm, two bucks... And it only transports matt...
                              I said I'll take it.
 This mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a...
                               Good night, losers!
             Man, how'd I live without this thing?
                              Oh, man that's good.
 Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated do...
                               It was your mother.
 Bart, are you in there? Have you forgotten our...
 I think she's right. The pants are a dead give...
 So then Lenny says, "As if! Don't even go ther...
                         Yeah, well Lenny said it.
                      Eh, it'll turn up somewhere.
                Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart.
   Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!
                                   Nice work, son.
                 Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.
 Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all to...
     Something I should have done a long time ago.
           I'll teach you to mess with my machine!
                          I'm gonna chop you good!
                            That cost me 35 cents!
 You're just making it worse. I promise I won't...
          That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa.
                 Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.
           They're in my hair! They're in my hair!
 C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you'r...
                                    She's a witch!
                                     I don't know.
             Oh, I've never heard of those people.
                                          Woo hoo!
                             Yes, yes, oh God yes!
     Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win.
                                          Bo-ring!
                Oh, but I want to do some rioting.
                                         All done.
       I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please.
 Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here,...
                            Watch the fish, Marge.
                       What did I tell you, Marge?
                               Oh, let's get that.
            Let's get that! The suffocation thing!
                  Five hundred dollars! Forget it.
 I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we...
 I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve p...
          I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.
                                         Oh, yeah.
                                             Baby.
                                          Mmm-hmm.
                                              Ahh.
                    Ooo, I like the sound of that.
 Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Jus...
                       Five days! But I'm mad now!
                     I'd kill you if I had my gun.
 Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's...

                                          Woo hoo!
 Close your eyes Marge, I've got a surprise for...

 You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't ...

                                            Sorry.

                                       Or would I?
             I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.
 All right, put your... Oh well, I'll rob it ne...
                                Sure thing, honey.
                  You want me to get the cat down?
                    See you in hell, dinner plate.
 Mmm, you probably left them at work. On anothe...

                    Oops, guess it already was on.
                  Uh. I'd better just put it down.
            All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you.
                          And I'm a wonderful man.
                Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.
 I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what ...
 But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you...
 So this is the thanks I get for protecting my ...
     Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!
                       They're here! They're here!
    Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.
                          Anyone else want a beer?
 I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
                                      Yeah, but...
                             I didn't get one yet.
 This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids....
               This stinks. I want my family back.
            Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?
                                            Sorry.

 Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's ...
 It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized,...
                                  Freeze, bad guy!
 I know I said that, but what I secretly meant ...

                                Then it's settled.
 Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this tea...

 Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's ...

     Then why are you running the obstacle course?
                                 You never use it.

 Well, if you know a better way for me to live ...
             I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?
                   My father never believed in me.

 Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it...
       It's okay, son. You'll do better next time.

 Exx-cellent poise, son. You panicked, but you ...
 Great debut, son. You really settled in after ...
   Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?

 Okay. Half of you vibrate that way, two of you...
      Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?
                                Are you sure, son?
                      I knew I could count on you.

 Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone...
                                         Gods, eh?

                             I still don't get it.
                         Oh I get it. I get jokes.

                  Enough of what's out! What's in?
       Yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way.
 Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... ye...
 All right. I can't waste any more time. People...
        That's it. Left. Left. Steady as she goes.
                      On second thought, go right.
                   Oh my God! We're all gonna die!

                                  Ask your mother.
                                               No.
                              Maybe for Christmas.
            Oh, will this horrible year never end?

                                 Oh, no you don't!
                        C'mon, get in there. Drop.

 No, sir. I'm really sorry sir. An older boy to...
 No sir, please. I can't go to prison. They pee...
                     No, please, I'll do anything!
                       I'm very happy to meet you.
 Okay, but could you pay me under the table? I ...
              Not spy, squeal. I've got no choice.
 Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this gove...
                       Does this make me look fat?
                                      But not fat.
 So if my cover gets blown and I need help, wha...
 Hey, I see you're watchin' the ball game. Look...

 Maybe. But first I need to hear about some oth...
             Uhhhh, like those. But involving you.
         Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.

 Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind o...

                       Uh, yeah, sure. That thing.
                           No you don't. Heh, heh.
                                             Ewww!
                                   Is that a fish?

                                          G'night.
                                Hmm, that's queer.
                                             What?
                                         The food!
                    Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?
                                             Okay.
 It was just the shock of seeing all that food ...
           Eh, I never thought I'd live this long.
 I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonn...
                                           Hmmm...
 When you think about it, mud is nothing but we...
 Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these far...
                                   That was close!
                          At your service, milady.
                                       Cara mia...
         Bart, I told you not to leave that TV on.
              No, no, honey. Maybe this will help.
 Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the week...
 Nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex...
        Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?
 If there's anything more exquisite than Queen ...
       Are you ready to rock? 'Cause heeere we go!
                     Um, no time like the present.
                              Well, yeah, kinda...
 Did that butter churn just move? 'Cause if it ...
        Mine too. Just like back in that hay loft.
 There's the dirty girl I married. Come on, I h...
           They didn't hear us in the sewing room.
                                 Hello, everybody.
                                        Bart! Yes.
                              Awww... Eskimo kiss!
   I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.
             Not yet. Wait... wait... wait... now!
 It hasn't changed since that magical evening w...
      Yeah, I thought Bart would be born a dimwit.
    Well, this time I'm drunk on love... and beer.
             Oh, why can't they just play through?
     Ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?
    Marge, can we trade? I don't trust these guys.
       Y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--
                                             Okay!
       Gil! Thank God it's you. You gotta help us.
               Honey, my shoulders are separating.
 Oh, we're surrounded, Marge. Maybe we should g...
 Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field d...
                     Grab onto the handles, Marge.
 Okay, I think I've figured this thing out. It ...
                              These have pleats...
 I'm okay, honey. Now listen very carefully. I ...
                       No, that was not the thing.
                                      Thank you...
 Marge, uh, can we not land here?... Honey?... ...
    Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.
                                  Dads especially!

 And I get my money from grease. What's the pro...
 Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if we'r...
 Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this ...

        Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?
 Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There...

 Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out...

               Look, son. Edison was just like me.
 No! We both lived in another man's shadow. Thi...
 We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dream...
 No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum ...
  Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney.

                            I needed my power fix.
   Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward.
 Man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooo...
                    Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!
                     Stand back and watch the pro.
                        Nah. They mess up my hair.

 The chair? How come they only do crucifixions ...
    Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!
                             This is legal, right?
            Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
                               Later, chickie-pie.
                         You sent me to the chair.
                    I know you are, but what am I?
                        It's hammer time, Snitchy.

     There. Now no murderers can get in... or out.
                                You are sooo dead.
                           Come here, you little--
          Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!
                 But I look so youthful and hunky.
                              The kid's gotta die.
                                But I love my son.
                    More than a lush head of hair?
                             Don't make me choose!
                                           Nooooo!
                                  I love you, son.
                              I'll show you, hair!

              They're milking rats! Milk-ing rats!
                                         Bart, no!
                        Oh, get that away from me!
 Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk....

                Do you have a table for the mayor?
                         Why do you talk that way?
 Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... ...

                Oh, I can explain that. You see...
                    Don Rickles zinged you, Marge.
                                Eat my dust, dust!
      Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week.
         Really? You think I should get it washed?
                                Hey, that's great.

       That's your problem. You're living up here.

                                 I don't think so.
   I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
                               Hey! Lance Murdock!
        He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death.
                Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him!

                              Welcome to my world.

 Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay.....
                     Ned, no! Think of your wives!
 Wait a minute. This could be some kind of scam...
                           Ahh, precious memories.
                             What did you call me?
                        Sure. Sock it to me, baby.
                                   We are so dead.
 Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. So ...
 But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear...
      Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie.
  Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.

                          So, who won? The losers?
                                           Losers.

 Excuse me, Uh, Mr. Scalper, sir. Have I told y...
 Okay, Moe. I believe you had me by the throat....
                        Gentlemen, I have an idea.
                                              Run!
                                          Woo hoo!
                    We can still make the kickoff!
                                Let us outta here!
 Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, clea...
 I didn't ask for your life story. Just give me...
                   Man, that's gonna be some show.

                            Well, it's about time.
  Ow! Oh! All right, Lovejoy! You're gonna get it.
      But this might be my last chance to win one.
           Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.
                                         What one?
                                             Door?
                                            Phone?
                                         Dog, cat?
 Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scoreca...

 There's "The Laughter Family." That's animated...
 Gee... I never thought I'd say this about a TV...
 Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever do...
                                   This is better.
                          He's named like my name!
 Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly...
                        Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa.
 Y'ello... yes, this is the original Homer Simp...

               And that's the end of that chapter.
                   All right. And what's the name?
                      Take it or leave it... Carl.
 Mmm, who knows? Maybe I'll have to foil an ass...
                     Yup. Right down to the scarf.
 Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Sim...
 No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just a...
    Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!
                            Gentlemen, I bid you--
                     Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa!
 I can't understand what happened. Why did they...
    That does it! There's only one thing I can do.
        I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
 Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, b...
 People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get ou...
           Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home.
                             Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's.
                  C'mon, people. Enough is enough.
                                             Okay.
 The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat...
                       And that big yellow flower.
 Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, ...
                                     Yeah. "Bart."
 Uh, so, I just want to know how come you made ...

                                Dynamic, isn't it?
 That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, ...
                                     Yes, briefly.
 Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off.
 Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap your...
 And it doesn't stop in the bedroom. Oh no, I'm...

                        Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power.
        Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer.
           Yeah, but I usually have three or four.
                         Tie good. You like shirt?
 Marge, this is Thai food. From now on, I want ...
                  When Trent Steel bought me some.
       He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.
                       Oh, I spit my gum in there.
 No way, this guy's a winner. He has a company ...
                              For all of us. Look.

       Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch...
                                  Hey, no problem.
                                   Woo, privilege!
                                            Whuh?!
          Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!
    Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
                 Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!
  What's going on, Trent? Where are you taking me?
                 Oh, this is the worst party ever.
 Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on ...
          Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.
 That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy ge...
                                   Tree-huggers...
 No, I just thought it was cute when you called...
                                I can't lose them!
 Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!
                                I'm free! Woo hoo!
                           Right after Happy Hour!
      So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?
                                             What?

                         Oh, don't make me choose.
                 Yeah, I'm going right to the top.
       Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word.

                             Roses. So many roses.
                                            Roses.
  Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!
          Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here!
                                 You drive. I eat.

                             And that's it, right?
                 But that's not for awhile, right?

        That's no way to address Sir Drinks-A-Lot.
                                             Okay.
   Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?
                                      Well, Marge?
               What's your favorite radio station?
                 Hey, that's super! See you later.
   Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad.
                            They know I'm kidding.

     Finally, a company that understands my needs.
                               So we're even then?
                        It's called caring, Marge.
 Ya gotta admit, Marge, that's a lot more roaming.

 Well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack, Jack ...
                  Bart, stop squeaking your chair!
    If you've got to do something, click this pen.
                         Hey, that looks like fun.

                                Really? Like what?
 Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me...
                      A bat! Now that's a new one.

 Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having...

                           He's undead, all right.
        Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
 Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. ...
                              Flanders, stop that.
        Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?
               Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood.
                                       Absolutely.
                                   Doin' what now?
 That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be ...
                                            Uh-oh.

                                         Stop! Ow!
                          I'm caught on something!
               But I was gonna loot you a present!
                       Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders?
                        Implied, Lisa? Or implode?
                           Thank you, sweet clown.
                        In death you saved us all.
           I can still hear his voice on the wind.
                Just like the dead clown promised.
                                        That's us!
 Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from ...

           Tom Arnold?! What the hell's going on?!
                           So we're all gonna die?
       The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!
                           Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell.
             Ooo, you don't want to get Zorro mad.
                                  Not fast enough!
                         I have to go to ze lobby!
 You're not supposed to go to the bathroom with...
                                To the top please.
                                Swim, my pretties.
                                        Sh-sh-shh!
                               Woo! You go, Zorro!
        Why that little... He insulted your honor!
                       Sir, I demand satisfaction.
                        I challenge you to a duel.
              Will you duel, or are you a coward?!
                         Uh, uh. "H" is for Homer.
           Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean?
 No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted...
 I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel.
 Really? But you've never given anyone a free b...
 Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little...
                               BABY, GLOVE SLAP...
 Coming through... challenge... duel... Hi Lenn...
                                              Huh?
                                        Aisle six?
   Duelling at dawn? How did it ever come to this?
  Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?
                                               Oh.
 Oh, honey, I had the worst nightmare. This glo...
                         He's out there, isn't he?
                            Hey, I'm not dead yet.
                      Save me, Marge. I saved you!
     Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go.
    And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.
 Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southe...
 I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle...
                                     Ah, screw it.
                        Ooh! How 'bout that house?
                                  Lousy show-offs.
  Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum.
                                 Come on, move it!
                                How should I know?
  'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?
                                         Zo-rrooo!
 Rural route 9? That's it! We can hide out at t...

                                 You little scamp.
 Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpso...
        That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!
    All right, let's see what the old girl can do.
                                          Hang on.
                                     And... there.
                                Now we're talkin'!
                                    Go get Lassie.
                   This car was made in Guatemala.
                 I bought these shoes from a hobo.
            I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming.
                             Aw, what do you know?
                     Oh, that's just superstition.
      You watch me. I'll grow something out there.
           Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that.
                   Oh, a little bit of everything.
 Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless...
 And for those who face nature unafraid, it is ...
                             Move the handbrake...
                              Ohhh, that's heaven.
   Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?
                          I'm only one man, Marge.
              Oh, who am I kidding? I'm no farmer.
                    Leave me alone, you big bully.
 Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be...
 Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such...
                                    Wait a minute.
                      Easy... careful... steady...

                                         A sprout!
                            And there's some more!

                                 Aw, thanks honey.
  Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?
 Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for ever...
              You're scaring the customers, honey.
                                             Okay.

 They'll be back. We control the world's supply...
                           Stop eating our future!
     Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home!
                      Thank God, there's one left!
                            Look, a flying saucer!
 There, there. We had quite a scare today. But ...
 I know, honey. But what can I do, as an indivi...
                                 I agree, but how?
                        They're after the tomacco!
   Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is...
                               No, I'd rather die!
                                          Take it!

                     Hey, are we duellin' or what?
          I think so. The bone stopped the bullet.
                                        After pie.
                       Snooze... need more snooze.

 Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work. No tim...
                              Oooh, where's Waldo?
 Nope. Nope. This would be a lot easier without...
                            Waldo, where are you?!
                           Oh sure. Single me out.
                                       Over there.
 Heh, heh. I'd hate to see the look on ol' Burn...
 Mmm, who is that? Big ugly nose... bald... liv...
    No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
                      Safe in the core. And now...
                       This is the worst day ever.
 Mr. Burns is making me eat all these drums of ...
                                             Okay.
            Oh, Marge, I'm sorry. I can't make it.
 The cooling tank just blew and they're taking ...

                            Are poo and ass taken?
               Damn! Could my life get any worse?!
 Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on ...
                                What a rotten day!

                                               Ow!
       Woo hoo! I'm ten pins away from perfection.
          Why won't they come over? I'm so lonely.
                     Get down, get down, get down!
     Woo hoo! This is the greatest day of my life!

                         Yes, Bart's weird friend.
             You've got a father. He's just a dud.
                                    Next question.
                Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on.
          Um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?

         Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again.
         That's right. You've got a special daddy.

                                          Mm-hmmm.

                                    I do what now?
 Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could us...
                    I can see I'm not needed here.

                  C'mon, Maggie. You can trust me.
                     Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!
 I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things bet...
              What are you pointing at? The ocean?
     That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.
 See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub....
       Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.
 And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy ca...
 Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink...
                             Maggie! Call Aquaman!
 Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me.
                               Oh, you do love me!
    Actually, that was before I went in the ocean.
                                       Then don't.
 Well, all I care about is that my little girl ...

    Hey, Apu, Manjula. You guys are still married?

                   My mistake. Stay in the moment.
                        And that's my cue to exit.
 I just wanted to invite you to the wrap party....
        Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.
 Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they show...
                   Yeah. It looked just like that.
                      Mine tasted like strawberry.
                                Mmm... Ovulicious.
 Free baby cola? Apu hits the jackpot, and I'm ...
           I've been waiting so long to hear that.
 Ooh, look at that. Ooh, gingerbread house. Han...
                    Boy, that Hansel sure can eat.
                      My corneas! You were saying?
     Eight kids. Hm, I'm sterile, right baby doll?
                                        Beautiful.
 Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling ab...
               Marge... They've turned into jerks.
                                    No, Marge. No!
                      She's no Liza, but it works.
           Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.
                          There... and... there...
                      Okay, this is gettin' weird.
 Please, Mr. Kidkill, look into your heart. I k...
                                     Not any more!
  Okay, okay... don't panic. Release the mongoose!
 Stupid mongoose! get the snake! The snake! Do ...
                           What an age we live in.
                            I remember television!
                         Nah. We'll go next month.
 Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like...
                           What an age we live in.
 Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance fl...
                              That's right, never!
       Oh! I need a dance partner! What about you?

 It's mine. Finally, I've won the respect of my...
                          Promise you won't laugh?
                                 I don't know how.
                                Will you teach me?
                        A gang! That's the answer.
        Remember to rebel against authority, kids.
 Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying ...
                I know, I know. Just tune her out.
 Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' ...
              Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa.
 You know, if you want to be in the gang, event...
  This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos.

             How could I be down a thousand bucks?
                       And what if we don't, Pops?
                They printed my photo of our gang!
 Carl looks great. Can't take a bad picture of ...
 If you'd've been awake you would have said no....
 You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coinciden...
                                             Okay.

                                    I'll show you.
 Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there...
       Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn.
                      I guess I'll never find her.

 So when Dean Peterson opens his door, this buc...
                                   He-- What the?!
                  Oh, real original. Who did this?
              Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!
                               Now who's the dean?
 Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? Oh, ...
                What guys? I wanna see the freaks.
                                   Easy... easy...
                                          Too far.
                             What? I can see fine.
           That had nothing to do with the bucket.
                                 Cure me! Cure me!
              Yeah. And I got a bucket on my head!
                        I see the light! It burns!
                                  Uh, Miracle Boy?
          I believe I had hair. Oh, here they are.
 I can't come up with an idea for my homecoming...
                   Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...
                               Yeah, you're right.
                                It's not to scale.
                                  And chili fries!
               Can't make a float without flowers.
                                             Yeah.
                                 Woo hoo! Go S.U.!
             Yeah, well you went to a cow college!
                Okay, who needs another lamb rack?

                      Out of the way, Baryshnikov!
       Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit.
 No, wait! I got a kid who's a miracle worker! ...
                                     Or else what?
                          Oh, right. The ice pick.
                           Bart, I need a miracle!

                        Poor guy. He lost his leg.
 This is my year, Marge. Everyone knows I'm wha...
                                          Wha...?!
                                      Who are you?
                    Everyone gets an award but me.
            Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?
             I mean an award that's worth winning.
                               What's that, sonny?
          Well, that was a great night for us all.
     Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
                    Look at me, I'm a billionaire!
 And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.
                           Wasteful AND practical.
   A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge.
                    Now I'm ready to hit the town.
                                        I'm drunk!
                     Look how loud I have to yell!

              Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge.
  Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party.
                               What about partays?
                                             Damn!

   Flanders? Since when do you like anything cool?
      Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes.
                                 Oh, I missed one!
                Let's go! New tires! C'mon, c'mon!
                 Oh, how rude of me. My name is...
                                           My bad.
                                          Finally!

 And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodby...
                     I know. No more being a jerk.
                                          Finally.
     Quit hogging Flanders. I want to comfort him.
                Then I insist on walking you home.
 Those feelings are normal, Ned. They're part o...
 It's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkl...

 Yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd sa...

 But, uh, there's no point in playing the blame...

        Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?

             And his own car? That's Ned Flanders.
                    A man who's not afraid to cry.
                                         Hey, Ned.

                                          Finally.
         Why are you torturing me? I'm just a man.
                      Well, why didn't you say so?
 Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars t...
                                    Done and done.
                    Eh, how're they gonna find me?
          Oh, why did I register with Insta-trace?
                Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart.
                      That's it, boy! Go get help!
   Okay Homer, don't panic. Let me do the talking.
 Umm... It's an honor to give ten thousand doll...

 Well, then we've got a problem. The banks are ...

                                             Done.

                                     I'm on board.
         Just give the word, and I'll cut him off.

     Yes. I humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
                                           I know.
     Maybe for you. How come you didn't rescue me?
   Well, you could treat me with a little respect.
                  You see, that's what I'm saying.

                          I don't have a computer.
 That does it. I'm getting a computer! As soon ...
                                Oh. I'm so stupid.
                 Uh... I guess I'll take that one.
 Well, a paperweight would be nice, but what I ...

           I could ask you the very same question.
                                        Would you?

                             You'd do that for us?

                                            Uh-oh.
    Well, look at that. But who called the police?
 'Course he did, son. He's a filthy crook. Now,...

                           Ah, you saw our bus ad.
                  We might be able to do business.
                Hey, where're you going with that?
  Wait a minute, no investor could bend like that.

         The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.
                                     Yes, darling?
                No. No, no, no. You're my partner.

        Comin' through... Hey, hi Otto... Sorry...
 Hey, that's great. Listen, I need a new double...
          Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son.
            Hm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go!
                                    Booo! You rot!
                                        Up- bup...

 Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run acros...
                                             Yeah.
   Everybody's been dumped but me. I'm undumpable.

                                      Who are you?
                  Which one am I? Serena or Venus?

                Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous!
           So, I notice your home smells of feces.

                      Look at me, I'm a scientist!

                               Here, little fella.
        I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot.
                        Ooo, can I have a brownie?
                           Ooo, can I have dinner?

      Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!
           Reattach a thumb? This isn't "Gattaca."
                       Okay boy, drop the thumb...
                        Nobody's gonna tackle you.
                          Come back with my thumb!
 Come on! Come on, boy! Oh, please give it back...
                          I have nothing he wants.
                            Give me back my thumb!
                                              Gaa!

                      But I have finger insurance!
                                     Symmetry, eh?
        We need more ice! My thumb is fading fast.
               Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb!
                                      Thanks, Moe.

                       Oh, why isn't this working?
                         Hey, thanks for stopping.
                           Oh, crap. It's on fire!
         Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?
    Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
                                    It's too late.

           Did you ever see that "Blue Man Group?"
                                  Abra-ca-thumbra.
    Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
                                 What the hell...?
                                     Linguo, dead!
               Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!
       One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven.

                                  Leave Ned alone.
 He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she...
                    Does -- Rachel -- like -- Ned?
       Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties.
                       Hey, she's coming this way!
    Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going.
           Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime.
                          He can hear you, Rachel.
    Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?
                      Yeah, maybe it was too soon.
              Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?
                            Say bye, Mr. Flanders.
                     Yeah, a lifetime of memories.

 Hang on, everybody. Three, two, one... Blast off!
                               Aw, that's my girl.
                           Is there a snack table?
                                  Don't film this.
     'Cause the thing is, there are no bad kids...
    Sorry. Daddy thought you were a pile of cable.
 My kids wear these hearts to remind them they ...
                 Yes, through the magic of caring.
                               I'll mace you good!
 Please let me win this, Lord. 'Cause if you do...
                                              Yes!
         All my love has come back in trophy form.
                                        I'll call.

                                 Why you little...
         No! No! No one is taking my kids from me!
                               Run, children! Run!
 Uh... For frosty chocolate milkshakes. Frosty ...
        I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
                                            Uh oh.
 Why did you rat me out, kids? Was it because I...
 Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two...
 Now let's all enjoy the snack table while we s...
                             Yeah, that'll happen.
                                        Teamsters.
               The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
  Hey, wait a minute. "Airport tax, five dollars?"
 Well, we are not boarding that plane unless yo...
                    Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.
                The Simpsons are ridin' the rails!
                      What are you gonna do to us?
                    Man, buffalo are easy to kill.
 All right, but your next story better be worth...
                              Oh, this'll be good.
                                         Whoopsie.
 A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for ...
 I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how...
              What have I done? What have I done?!
                                            Aww...
                                         Big deal.
          I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.
                      I'll meet you in Wilmington.
          Raise your arm... Okay, the other one...
 Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I...
                                              It--
                                               Ew!
 And it's important to feel good about yourself...
 Ah, Ethnictown. Where hard-working immigrants ...
                Wait, this is just a shaved puppy.
 The perfect crime. Marge, I have to be in cour...
 A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony...
      So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
                                            Beads!
                                             Owww!
                   Hey, that's me. And that's you.
                                        What-ever.
                          Are you coming on to me?
                                      Good as new.
           Well, I... There. Right as rain, there.
 Marge, that "curse" is just a lot of silly sup...
                            Guys, I am not cursed!
     Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!
                             When did that happen?
 Let's make sure he's a leprechaun. Sing us a s...
 Ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themse...

                                        Ew! Nasty!
          Yep. Everything worked out for the best.
   Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back.
                         She's not the boss of me.
                                 Mm, various eggs.
 Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant ...
                                      Oh, I agree.
                Yeah, that's the price of success.
                          What's my blood alcohol?
                                  Keep 'em comin'.
                                 Yeah, she's cool.

                            Mm, unexplained bacon.
                                   Good ol' table.

 Well, I am missing the back of my head. I thin...

      Yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special...
                            My sweet little angel!

                            End of the line, boys.
                            I love our court days.
                  Judge Snyder? While we're young?
                        I'll bring the car around.
                    What'd she say about cupcakes?

                                       Room five?!
                              It's a little tight.
                                     I used to be.
                  Oh, this punishment is so cruel.
                              I'll medicate you...

 Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything ...

                                        Sure, boy.
 Oh, son. You know that's none of your business...
          Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes...
 Really. You like skateboards? We're sure learn...
                 Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer.
                               I hit my head, Moe.
                                       Since when?
              All right, all right. Come on, Bart.
                         That's my little slugger.
 Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundre...
                            Yeah, they're Italian.
                                 Moe? What the?...
                              It's about time. Oh.
            Well, that's a pretty big "if," honey.
       Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle.
                                               No!
 Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. ...
 Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you shoul...
 What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times ...
         Why not? Kids are very visual these days.
                                            But...
                                     Hey, shut up.
                                    Ow! Why you--!
                           Because I... Ow! You--!
                                               Ow!
                                               Ow!
                                               Ow!
                                 Why you little...
              We're free! Your mother set us free!
                                          Woo hoo!
                    Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha.
       But, Constance, it only happened because...
 Wait. I'm to blame, Judge. You see, I was pres...
                                       I admit it.
      Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately.
                                            Sorry.
                                           Dammit!
                     Well, that explains the sign.
 You know, we could get out of these stupid thi...

                            Hey, Marge, surf's up!
             Well, we tried all those other tools.
                                          Woo hoo!
     Now, time for "Operation: Judge-Get-Back-At."
 Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's...
 It's only the milkman. Hey, maybe I should be ...
                       This address must be wrong.
    She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool.
                  I know, I know. Fight the power.
                                             Cops!
         Look at her in there, washing her body...
 I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there'...
                    Oh, it's just a friendly seal.
                                     Shut-uuuup...
               Oh Lord, guide this cinder block...
                                            Uh-oh.
                                Hey, how ya doin'?
                        So... it cost you nothin'.
                                   That was close.
                             Just the radio, dear.
 The bridge column. Oh, that South. You never k...
                       Probably digging for drugs.
                                No. Of course not.
 Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up...
 Oh hello, young man. Beautiful day for digging...
     Yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?
 So, I guess you wouldn't mind if I was to dig ...
                                     Maybe I will.
                                      Very little.
                           I'm having chest pains!
                        Where's the defibrillator?
                                            Clear!
                       This thing pays for itself.
   Yes. Eventually, I became King of the Morlocks.
                      You callin' me a liar, Carl?
                     Oh, I just naturally assumed.
                                          Woo hoo!
        Geez Moe, you've been a real crank lately.
 Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. Yo...

                        That was an amazing throw.
             Hey, where'd that painting come from?
                                Ooh, ooh, pick me!
        Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.
 No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy be...
                 I thought you said you had to go.
       Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?
  Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?
            But on the other hand, Moe's not here.
 For what? A little splattered food never hurt ...
 Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like...
                                             Ayyy!
                      Oh! Whoa! Hemorrhage-amundo!
                                             Ayyy.
                                            Yello?
     Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?
                                   I don't get it.
                                   What's the gag?

                         Not for friends of Moe's.
                          Don't you know who I am?
                           Cecil is a girl's name.
                       Um... the rabbits are cute.
                Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.
                Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.
                                  Okay, look cool.
                                        That's it!
 I'm gonna tell Moe exactly what I think of his...
                        Moe, we want our bar back.
 Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turn...
                 I'll throw myself out, thank you.
                            I believe I had a hat.
                                          Suckers!

                                        Oh, sorry.
                                       No problem.
                  But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted.
   Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.
            You're going to ask her to marry you?!
           Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
                  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
                     Let go of her or I'll scream!
                      Well, this is my house. Ah--
             Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape.

                                         Bye, Moe.
 Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away.
                                            Never!
               This is it. This is the old quarry.
                Someone's yellow belly is showing.
 And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see...
                  And someone has eaten the flesh.

                                     How was that?
 So, you think you know better than this family...

                                  One, two, three.

                         Okay, but talk like this.
                                             What?
   Look, Gabriel. We're learning to work together.
 Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger...
          No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz.
                           Hey, they're all right.
           WOLVES AND COUGARS ATE OUR ROAST BEEF!!
                                        I knew it!
  Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.
            Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!
                              Give it to me, baby.
                         It's okay. We're married.
 Marge, I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. Liqu...

                      Please, just leave me alone.
 Oh, yeah... Oh, that's good... Oh, don't stop....
 Faster... Faster... Faster... Oh, you do that ...
                                 Use both hands...
                    Can't panic! Must remain calm.
 Ah, the sweet couple of seconds before I remem...
                     Marge, you're speaking to me.
                  Talk about what? Sports? Bigamy?
                            Not a sports fan, huh?
 You know, there are only so many times I can s...

              Oh my God! Wow. Now that's a goiter.

   Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra.
                               Wait, wait, wait...
                                But it's my banjo.
                  Yeah, they're called "Congress".
                                             Okay.
                                      Group stunt?

                                            Mm-hm.
 All right. I'll make a base camp here and try ...
                                   Why you little!
                                    Wait a minute.
             Ha! Ha! We did it! Springfield rules!
                  Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!
 Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I...
                Yeah, you can't improve on nature.
 Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there ...
 Well, well. If it isn't the woman who's too bu...
                                    It was dinner.
           I was hoping we could do that together.
                         Oh, I am so proud of you.
                                   Get in the car.
 Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group...
 Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. O...
                       Nothing left! Nothing left!
                          Ooh, ooh, a sticky spot!
                             Part of me knew that.
            I'm with you all the way. But first...
                 Cool. Should I take off my shoes?
                                             Cool.

 Come on! Give it! I know, I'll try reverse psy...
                     That wasn't part of the deal!
     Has everyone keistered their personal supply?
                            'Cause I sure haven't.
              No way! We'll defy you to the death!

 I'm not scared of those ushers! What are they ...

                     My mouth. My beautiful mouth.
                                       Broken jaw?
                                            Uh-oh.
                                           Mm hmm.
                                        I'm horny!
                                      Nicely done.

                      Drivers, start your engines!
            But bold moves are no longer my forte!
                   Oh, what do I do? What do I do?
 Ah, this beer's deliskous. I'm gonna saves me ...
                             Quit banging my wife!
 Looks like I need some fuel for me mule. Gas f...
 Aw, looks like a little angel. Now to save me ...
 That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket....
             Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge!
       Unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
                                  What's goin' on?
 Hey Marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any ...
                              Spill it, moneybags.
 It's like being married to my best friend, and...
 Hm, a million dollars? Wait a minute. How much...
           Hey Marge, I just thought of something.
 If we had Artie's money, I could get that snor...
          One squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
                                        Yeah, I...
                     Honey, did you get any sleep?
                                 Oh, I'm so sorry.
                                           Uh huh.
 Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no...
 And by funny stuff I mean handholding, goo goo...
 This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday co...
    Yeah. Homer sold his wife for a million bucks.
 I didn't sell her. I just rented her to an old...
 Gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a l...
 Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for...
 Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back ...
                            That's enough running.
 Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once...
                               Hello, Dondelinger.
                       Just for twenty-five years.
 Oh no. If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be b...
 Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing ...
 My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to...
  Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.
 I saw something terrible, and I can't even say...
 I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see ...
                      Patty and Selma? Screw that!
                Just run the camera, you little...
                              Goodbye, my darling.
 Oh, it's no good. Everything reminds me of Marge.
                              What did Carl think?
 Do you have any jobs for a man who wants to di...

 Why? So I can watch my wife spend the rest of ...
                               We said "Good day"!
                                          Woo hoo!

 But knowing about it would make you want to go...
       Ten-four, princess. Is that your beer tent?
                                               Ow!
                                      Monkeys cry.
                               Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee!
                                            Sorry.
 Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flander...
 Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, ...
                                In South Carolina.
                                     You will too!

                            What the hell is that?
            Wow, what kind of mileage does it get?
 Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, she's looking at us....

      All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!
       Doesn't matter. They have free health care.
                                         I'm rich!
             Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?
                                There she is, boy.
 Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So ...
 Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you. I'm gon...
                Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie.
                                        Oh, right.
                    Really? Ooh, this I gotta see.
                Oh, he just wants to make friends.
 Ooh, who's a good dog? What a goody doggie! Oh...
                               He's a good doggie!
                      Ooh it-it ooh googie googie!
 Look Bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you...
                                    Just you wait!

        And he never even lived to be a vegetable.
  Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him.
 Sure, I said I loved him. But never that I was...
 Aw, Dad... We've got what people never get, a ...

                                 That was a D.W.I.
      Well, you brought me into this world, so no.
                                      Dad, get up.
                                           No way.
 Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll prob...
  Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down!
                                     No you can't.
                        You're slow to react, Dad.
                        In real life he would die.
                             Hey, watch the movie.

                                 Good night, Bart.
                                 Good night, Lisa.
                               Good night, Maggie.
                     Cherish these moments, Homer.
 What the-- You earned how many credits without...
                                Against my wishes!
 Oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. But ...
                                     Oh, come on--
                                     You're right.
 I was trying to throw Bart over the roof, and ...
                     Marge, where's my pellet gun?
                                            Right.
                        Oh no, not the good cheek!
                                               Oh.
 Guys, I just ordered my wife the greatest anni...

                        Hey, hey, hey, no peeking.
                         Happy anniversary, Marge!
                      What the hell is that noise?
 Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is...
                            Fine, I won't kill it.
                                   Finish the job.
      Are you sure God doesn't want it to be dead?
          If he wants to sleep with us, forget it.
 Once upon a time there were three bears. The end.
           Oh fine, I'll go back to the beginning.
 Oh no, I crushed that horrible bug. What shoul...
                                Uh, he's sleeping.
          Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh...
     Woo hoo! He's alive. Now you can't punish me.
 Lousy Community Service. Meals on wheels! Eat ...
                Uh, they discontinued the cobbler.
      Now let's not get into who smells like what.
                                   Safe and sound.
                                    That's better.
 Thank God. I'm out of matches. Oh no, here's a...
 Please don't kill me! I won't tell anyone abou...
                           But what about the axe?
                           Eh, you're the shut-in.

 Hello?... Uh-huh. Yes Mrs. Bellamy, I'll be ri...
 Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. ...
                                         Laxative?
           The Missus prefers you call me Simpson.
                                Are you all right?
       Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--
                                            O-kay.
                    Buh... guh... muh... wuh. Zuh.
                                  Without a trace.
 Oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. From our...
 Now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... DOES...
                                    Book 'im, Lou.
                    You'd be dead a million times.
          Oh man, what a day. I'd kill for a beer.
                   I'd stab somebody for a pickle.
                               Gimme some peanuts.
  I'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
                 What? It goes right by our house.
                       Here's my underwear drawer.
                          Mrs. Bellamy's necklace!

 Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise ...
 Y'know, this is our last night... and our cell...
            Just think of them as twinkling stars.
 I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old...
                             Now you do it for me.
                                   Goodbye, Marge.
                                            What?!
                                        I knew it!
 This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never be...
 Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I thi...
                              I've made my choice.
                              So hot, so sticky...
                                           Marge?!
 You know what will cool this place down? A lit...

           Oh, no! They're stealing the tire fire!
                                               No.
                                               No.
 No! I've caused enough trouble already by plug...
                  All right, but not the imported.
                  You've got to set limits, Marge.
 Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhous...
   Oh. Seriously, everyone says your parties rock.
 I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel g...
                                     Wrong answer.
            Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?
 That's it. Nobody messes with my little girl. ...
 See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I...
 Interesting. All right, I've come up with a co...
                                          Exactly.
 Look at him over there, eating that apple. Wha...
                        You're right. What's this?

                          From "The Woolly Bully."
                                 Do you sell hats?
                                        To people?
                                People with heads?
             Did you steal dolls from my daughter?
     Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie.
                   Good, 'cause I need directions.
                                             Aw...

                                Speed it up, ugly.
                            Eh, he had a good run.
                    I'm gonna need help with this.
                                             Hm...
                      No, you've got chores to do.
 Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed...
 Wow, four of me. I think this could be a magic...
                   I'll take it from here, Fake-o.
                                           Uh-huh!
                       Man, are we evenly matched.
                                     I mean, four!
                       Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
     Yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card.

  Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me.
                              Hey, where's my car?
                   Will you make my sundae for me?
                 I'm hungry. Are they married yet?

                  Oh, it just needs a little love.
             Why do the things I love always burn?

      A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say?
                        I'm confused! Which is it?
 Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike ...
                 That's right. No questions asked.
                  There, there. You're both right.
 Son, would you like to ride your new bike out ...
                                    For true, son.
          Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
                          I'll assemble it myself.
                    I can make a bike. I made you.
 Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets so...
                     Oh man, this is so confusing.
                            What the Hell is this?
                                Bike's over there.

 Man, even I think movie popcorn has gotten too...
                              Get your own, mooch.
 Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet.
 Hey, my car insurance expired. Quite a while ago.
 That's it. From now on I'm not looking forward...

               Oh honey, I love to hear you laugh.
                                       Yes you do.

 Ahh, the Germans. You just can't stay mad at 'em.
                            You can just nurse it.

                                   That's my girl!

 Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now...
       This must be what it's like to be in space.
                   And yet, I've never been to me.
                    That sliding should stop soon.

        I was in so deep, I forgot pies were food.
                                    I'll show him.
                                  No, I shouldn't.
                                      Or should I?
                      I'll keep my promise, honey.
                  Since when do I listen to cakes?
 You're all so wise... I wish I could eat each ...
                 I've run out of pie-related puns!
         It's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!
                           I already work for you.
                           Do I get two paychecks?

 No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it.
                                            See...
                         You know I'm not Pie Man.
                  Oh come on, she's a little girl.
                                            Sorry.
                                   The Dalai Lama!
 I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she...
                 Please forgive me, talking llama.
 No. I won't. There's only one way I can escape...
                 I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!
                       Yeah. Let's go home, honey.
                                  Was it the kiss?
 Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will...

 It felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a grave...
                                          Whuh-oh.

 Now to do something I've never done before -- ...
      Here's a poem: "run fast, or lose your ass"!
                 Bart, you're grounded for a year.
                                Okay, three bucks.
       Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!
            I'm always happy to help you, sweetie.

 And while you're there, can you get my Frisbee...
           Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?

         Hmmm, I wonder if I could blow up Heaven?
         Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?
                        You're not the boss of me.

                             Woo hoo! Free cheese!
 What's happened to us, Marge? We used to feed ...

                      It's a conversation starter!
                       I swallowed a chicken bone.
                                         Same one.
                                 Good news, Marge!
             I've learned to walk naked on stilts!

 I just hate to see you upset, honey. You know ...
         Ladies! There's no need to fight over me.
                          Oh. Well then, carry on.
 All right. But while I'm gone, boy, you think ...

   Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
          So... do you wanna "wang chung" tonight?

                         She doesn't recognize us!
      You monster! What have you done to my face?!
                      When will Marge remember us?
                                         Jogging?!

                           I do eat a lot of crap.

                                              Boo.
             Well, the rest of your life for sure.
                              That might be Marge!

  Okay pretty boy, where's Fat Tony's fifty bucks?
                                 It'll do for now.

                        Maggie! You did all this?!
     And to pay you back, I'm returning your nose.
 Here's your nose. Daddy's putting back your nose.
                     Oh, wait. That's Lisa's nose.
                                    Thanks to her!

                        How could you not tell me?

 Wow, you guys are good. The alien's right here...

             Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?
            Then I now pronounce us "just dating."
 I love kissing you. I never want to knock it off.

                 A simple "yes" would've sufficed.

         Is that why you brought me here, spirits?
                       I guess that would be nice.
                                     Really? Sure.
                                     Thanks, guys.
        Hey, was there another plaque here before?
                   Now let's get something to eat.
                                           God no!

     We live in a house that is trying to kill us.

 Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe....
                             I see you! I see you!
                                           I see--

              Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
 No, Marge. You're the most giving person I kno...
    You told me something, but I wasn't listening!
                Fair enough! Kids, let's practice.
                                  Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
 That was good, but Lisa, you're still complain...
                             Maybe it's beef stew!
                                         Hot tubs!
                             Guys, what's it like?
              I want to buy your fanciest hot tub!
      Please, can I get it, Marge? Please? Please?
     Beats me. / I'unno. / Please, please, please!

              Ooh, lemon. That'll stop the cherry.

                      Could you scooch over a bit?
                                         I'll try.
     Barn, thanks for picking up the money for me.
 Now, what should I buy first? Hitler's basebal...
                                          Oh yeah.
                        Marge? What are you doing?
 Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help...
 Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, yo...
     I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
                                       Catch, boy!
 Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why ...

                           You go rent us a truck.
 And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to...
        Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.
                                Why... I'm just...

                                             Wait!
 Do you think you could use someone like me in ...
          I said someone like me, I didn't say me.
      Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!
                          Race you to the cockpit!
              Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.
 With that attitude, you'll never super in one ...
 Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing to...
        Blackmail your father in space, will you?!
                       Up -- that's my chair, boy.
 Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take...
                        I agreed to no such thing!
                              Where and what time?
                                            Never!
                                   What do I wear?
            Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.
 Boy, this has gone too far -- I quit! As soon ...

                                       It's stuck!
                         Can I help you with that?
 I'll do it myself. When we do things together,...
              Ooo, you're hot when you're horny...
              Ooo, you're mad when you're angry...
    Marge, you're really good with your left hand.

 That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
                                 I could kiss you.
  Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.

 Don't worry, Sarah. Clancy was there for me. A...

                    Fine! I'll stay a little more.

 Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy.....
                        Hey man, you planted that!
              Oh, everything reminds me of Clancy.
                                       Everything.

      Hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal.
                I'm starting to regret it already.

 That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him ...

 It kills me to see her like that. And if there...
 Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I go...

 Sharks, innocent? Please. Every year they kill...
            Ooh, a baby whale. My diet is working.
   Ooh, maybe the blood will scare the sharks off!

                        Mmmm. Good mac and cheese.
               I'll have to check it out sometime.
                                              Mmm.

 Into the playpen, sweetie. And if you get hung...
                                    It's from Moe!
        Moe is running off with one of our wives?!
                                      I got Marge!
             Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!
          You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!
                                        Aw dammit!
                            Can't talk! Must text!

                             Marge, this is crazy!
                                        Flanders?!
                                        All right.

 I was there when your wife got to Moe's, being...

                    Marge! No! Stop packing your--
                               Painting supplies?!
                            You're not leaving me?
 Oh Marge, you not leaving with Moe is the best...

               Nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.
         Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again.
 All right, Sideshow. I'm gonna do to you what ...
               It's like you're a Chinese empress!
                          And I'm not a locksmith!
                Man, that dude does not like Bart.

                               That is disgusting.
 Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that ...
                                        Oh my God.
               You never fail to nauseate me, boy.
 I wanted to, but your mother said kids might t...
         Half an hour to show time, your ugliness.
    But if we win this, we get a gift certificate.
                                It doesn't matter.
 You can't close! I'll have to go home and drin...
 Oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his...
               Yeah. Now what am I supposed to do?
                                             Okay.
 Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I...
                             What are we watching?
     After the title page it's Bob Dole's memoirs.
 Now that I have all this free time, I thought ...
 I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything ...
 And I also mixed all the spices together into ...
          Uh-oh. What kind of ventilating is that?
 Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me t...
 Watchin' hockey! Watchin' 'em pass that puck! ...
                     Uh, the Long Island Ice Teas?
 Well, that place was for diehard sports fans, ...
 Ah, those guys are all crooks. They charge you...
                            Don't worry, I got it!
                        Marge! You ruined my shot!
 That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods ...
 It's four AM -- you kids should've been in bed...
                                 Oooh, the Nobies!
                                            Lucky.
                            I would kill for that.
                   Arctic Circle! I just got that!
                                    How easy am I?

 Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save ...

 Oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- ...
                                       Sure, sure!
                 Let me just grab one more shrimp.

                                 It's almost over.
                Now to take care of the witnesses.

                            No, no, I oversold it.
              I'd give anything to bring you back.
                                         Fat Tony?

                          I don't like those guys.
             Oh no. I left a candy bar in my desk.
                                 Time to punch in.

                          Woo hoo! No more church!
         So long, Sector 7-G...hello, Sector 22-F!
                You know, you're kind of a downer.
 I thought you were retiring. Why are you still...

                     Wow, these seats are amazing.
                                          Bo-ring.
 God, what a great game! And you too can be on ...
                    I can't believe that was work!
                                       Oh, well...
 I really should look at this picture a little ...
                                   Okay, let's go.
                                Can you be my dad?
         It's a rat race, but it looks like I won.
       Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you.
                                         And kiss.
      Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today.
                                     Close enough.
                        My work is so meaningless.

                   Uh... I got here after you did.
        Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking...
 Of course, of course. Family is everything to ...
 That's great, let me run the numbers because I...
           You're not a client. You're the client.
                      I'll handle it. I always do.
 Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because...
                                  Oh no you don't.
            It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is.
        Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me.
 Oh Marge, this is the most romantic trip you e...

                   Were you worried about me, boy?
                       Clearly the boy's in shock.

          We got a new tent from a guy who O.D.'d!
                 Aw, let me get a picture of that.

                                    What the rock?
                                     I did a lick?
                         Oh my god... I'm amazing.
                               I'm not set at all.
 This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I had...

 Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have...
                         Ooh! I've missed you too.

 You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you...
    What do you say, boy? Wanna split the lasagna?
                               Why you little...?!
                             It's good to be back.
                 Can we cuddle for a little while?
                                            It is!
 Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fight...
             This means war! Boy, bring my toupee!
                                    Go ahead, boy.

                                             Um...
 Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. In...
   Perfect! Just like when we let you name Maggie.
                                              Bye!

                         What about the chocolate?

                                 Well, not Maggie.
                    Okay, okay. Standing O or die!

 I have so many questions for you. First of all...
 You know, maybe I shouldn't be here. I promise...

                                 What do I do now?
                                    Oh, all right.

                   Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.
                           And you gave it to him?
                                    Eight million?

              See what I mean? Always an argument.
 But the thing you have to remember is that you...
           ...uh, because you want them to grow...
         ...and because you can't strangle a girl.
 Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks ...

        All right, as long as it's just questions.

            Stole? How is counting cards stealing?

            How many grades does this school have?
                       Who shall I say is calling?
                                 It's your sister.
 What? Why? Oh, yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma....
 Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter...
                                            Marge!
                Marge, where's the extension cord?
 Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas...
                                    ...Every year.

                                  Well, let's see.
                                They're all yours.
                                       Gimme that!
                                               So?
                                      Thanks, Moe.
                What's with the crazy getup, Barn?
                               Wow. Can I do that?
 What do you mean? All the time? Even when they...
                               Oh, I certainly do.
                         Huh, when do we get paid?

                               You both look well.
                      Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.
                                  And why is that?
        Well, I was just on my way out to get one.
                                               No!
                                            Uh-oh.
     So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isn't it?
                               That's an ornament.

                  Look, Adil. You can call me Dad.
                           Aww. You called me dad.

                               Marge, she's right.
 Listen, you big stupid space creature. Nobody,...
      Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.
                                Yeah, thanks Lisa.

 No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right...

 You are my brother. I love you and yet I feel ...

 Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on...
                   Your putter's name is Charlene!

                    I'm game if you are, Flanders.

     Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
                                    Not now, Lisa.
                                             What?
                                     Where, where?
                        Here you go, Bartasaurous.
                                 Oh I can't watch.
                      Bart, Bart. We're home, son.
                      Kids say such stupid things.
                  Come on Marge, we're mad at 'im.
                                            Ewwww.
 Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?
                             Oh, hi, kids. Thanks.

                           Oh. What are you doing?
                                    Heh, heh, heh.
                   Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
                                               No.
                 Everybody's looking at us, Marge.
 Oh. Well, how long are we going to have to be ...

                                        Oh, sorry.
                              I was watching that.

         Well, there he is... Michelangelo's Dave.
                          Oh. What's wrong, Marge?
 Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy ...
                              They're forcing 'em.
                                       He's awake!

        Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?
                             You mean duke it out?

           Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
                    No way! Because I'm not dying.

       Ignoramus. It means I'm stupid! Doesn't it?
                            Not to me there isn't!

 Because I'm sure we were meant to be together....

       Oh, goody! A program-length advertisements!
                                             Bart!
  Oh, great... All right, what makes you say that?

         Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.
                                             Bart!
 Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. I...
                                       Promise me.
                                         Good boy.

   Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.
  ...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
       Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down.
 It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge...
 Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Ugh! Socce...

 Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that ...
                                         Oh great.
               Just a select circle of my friends.
                  Oh, didja swipe those from work?

                                     Come on, boy.
 Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me...
                 Yeah, at the worst possible time.
          The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
                           Cable clippers, please.

                               I'll take that bet.

 Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk ...
                       Remember? Who could forget?
                But that was just an idle promise.
          Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't ...
                                      But Marge...
                                        All right.
                                             Okay.
 Hey! Why should she have a better husband than...
      Must find man. Must find man. Must find man.
           Boy, a good man really is hard to find.
                         One seafood burrito, Apu.
                                            Sorry.
                             What is it this time?
 But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skin...
 But if you weren't married to your job, you'd ...
 Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if...

 Ah, Moe. I've gotta find a date for my big, fa...
                       Like my wife's ugly sister.
       Hey, Selma's no prize pig herself you know.
 But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and...
            Oh, there's the little prom queen now.
                  Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!
                       Take it to the hoop, Selma.
 ... And thank you most of all for nuclear powe...
 Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart...
                                     Not one word.
                    I thought I said knock it off!
                   Well, no panta-ma-mime, either.
                The hospital? Y'ello... Oh my God!

                                   A half-brother?
 This makes me feel special, Dad. Since I'm the...

                  Twen... forty-eight. This is it.
                  Excuse me, is this an orphanage?
 Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed ...

 Woo woo! The H stands for Herbert! Herb, were ...

 That's okay, carry on. See the way I handled t...
                           What does it look like?
           Marge, this can't be the right address.
                                   Hello in there.
                                             Herb?
                    Holy moly! The bastard's rich!
 Herb, allow me to introduce my family. This is...
 ... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Mag...
            Yeah, though the boy was a close call.
              What's to know? Just dive in. Catch!
                        I feel the same about you.
                                  Even pork chops?
 You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the ...
 Wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got ...
                            Will you kids shut up?
                             Okay, we're watching.
 Hello, Cook? Sorry to bother you so late, but ...
           Are you sure you want to give me a car?
               Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then.
                                          Why not?
          Well, then give me one with lots of pep.

                     Uh, may I be excused, please?
                   Because you think I'm a genius?
                    Because you think I'm dynamic?
                You think I work well with others?
                                        Oh, great.
  Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars.
                                          Sort of.
                                             What?
